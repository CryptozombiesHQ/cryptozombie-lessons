In this chapter we'll show you how to generate the private key that you'll be using to deploy your smart contracts, and how to pass it securely to TronBox as an environment variable.

But before you do that, let's talk about the concept of test networks.

In a nutshell, a test network is used by developers to test their smart contracts in an environment that's similar to production.

Several TRON test networks let you test your contracts for free before you deploy them to the main net. These test networks use a different consensus algorithm than the main net, and TRX is free to encourage thorough testing.

> üëâüèª While testing is very important, it requires an entire lesson to cover ‚Äî so we‚Äôre just going to stick to deployment in this lesson.


In this chapter, you will be using the Shasta network.

## The tronbox.js configuration file

TronBox stores its configuration in a file named `tronbox.js`. Let's take a look at what's inside:

```js
const port = process.env.HOST_PORT || 9090

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    mainnet: {
      // Don't put your private key here:
      privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_MAINNET,
      /*
Create a .env file (it must be gitignored) containing something like

  export PRIVATE_KEY_MAINNET=4E7FECCB71207B867C495B51A9758B104B1D4422088A87F4978BE64636656243

Then, run the migration with:

  source .env && tronbox migrate --network mainnet

*/
      userFeePercentage: 100,
      feeLimit: 1000 * 1e6,
      fullHost: '<https://api.trongrid.io>',
      network_id: '1'
    },
    shasta: {
      privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_SHASTA,
      userFeePercentage: 50,
      feeLimit: 1000 * 1e6,
      fullHost: '<https://api.shasta.trongrid.io>',
      network_id: '2'
    },
    nile: {
      privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_NILE,
      userFeePercentage: 100,
      feeLimit: 1000 * 1e6,
      fullHost: '<https://api.nileex.io>',
      network_id: '3'
    },
    development: {
      // For trontools/quickstart docker image
      privateKey: 'da146374a75310b9666e834ee4ad0866d6f4035967bfc76217c5a495fff9f0d0',
      userFeePercentage: 0,
      feeLimit: 1000 * 1e6,
      fullHost: '<http://127.0.0.1>:' + port,
      network_id: '9'
    },
    compilers: {
      solc: {
        version: '0.5.18'
      }
    }
  },
  // solc compiler optimize
  solc: {
  //   optimizer: {
  //     enabled: true,
  //     runs: 200
  //   },
  //   evmVersion: 'istanbul'
  }
}
```

Pretty straightforward: it specifies a number of networks that you can deploy to. In order to deploy to one of these networks, you must set up the corresponding environment variable to provide the private key. In this lesson, you will be using the Shasta network, meaning that you must define an environment variable named `PRIVATE_KEY_SHASTA`.

Using an environment variable to pass your private key to TronBox is great from a sececurity perspective as we don't recommend storing secrets like a mnemonic or a private key in a configuration file, the reason being that configuration files are often pushed to GitHub, where anyone can see them, leaving you wide open to an attack.

## Put it to the test

1. Generate your private key by running the `node scripts/generate-private-key.js` command. In the tab to the right, you will see your private key. Copy it, as you'll need it in the next step. Note that due to the way our terminal works, you'll have to double-click on the hex-encoded string and then hold the mouse button down while you press `Ctrl+C` or `Command+C` to copy the key.

2. Let's create an environment variable named `PRIVATE_KEY_SHASTA` and set it to the private key displayed in the box to the right. To do so, enter the `export PRIVATE_KEY_SHASTA=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` command, replacing  the placeholder surrounded by `<>` with your private key.

>Note: If you run this command in a terminal, you may or may not enter spaces before and after `=`. However, since our command-line interpreter is pretty basic, it won't consider the answer correct unless you're dropping spaces.
