Welcome, CryptoZombie!

Now that you've got a bit of experience under your belt, we're going to deep dive into the blockchain ecosystem by teaching you how to deploy a smart contract to TRON.

But why would you want to deploy to TRON?üßê

To answer this, let's take a look at what TRON has to offer compared to other blockchains.

First, TRON uses the DPoS consensus algorithm which enables a maximum of 2000 transactions per second.

Second, transactions are cheaper compared to Ethereum.


Also, the team developed a lightweight Turing-complete virtual machine named TVM ("TRON Virtual Machine") that reduces resource consumption and improves system performance.

What is a Turing-complete virtual machine, you ask?

A virtual machine creates a level of abstraction between your code and the computer than runs it. This improves portability, and makes sure that applications are separated from their host. A Turing-complete virtual machine is a virtual machine that you can use to perform virtually any task as long as it has enough time and processing power.

First things first. If you're new to Cryptozombies, it's highly recommended that you go over the first six lessons before starting this one. Also, if you are not comfortable with JavaScript, consider going through a tutorial elsewhere before starting this lesson.

So you've worked your way through our previous lessons?

Awesome! That means you're ready to deploy your smart contractüí™üèª.

Although you‚Äôll be deploying the `ZombieFactory` smart contract you've written in the previous lessons, the steps you‚Äôll learn can be used to deploy your own smart contracts.

That being said, do you want to get access to much speedier and cheaper transactions? If so, read on...
