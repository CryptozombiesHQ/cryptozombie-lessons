Boom! We now have a function that can pull the latest price of Ethereum in terms of the United States Dollar!

Now, as you know, decimals places don't work so well in Solidity, so what happens when we try to call this function? What's the answer that we are going to get?

Well to save you the time, if we were to call this function, we'd get a response like:

```
310523971888
```

Wait... is Ethereum really that expensive?

Well, maybe sometime in the distant future it might be, but at the time of writing, it's not even close. Right now, the price is about `$3,105.52`.

So how do we know where the decimal place goes? Well, there is a `decimals` function that tells us!

Can you make a `getDecimals` function that returns how many decimals this contract has by just looking at the interface? I bet you can!

## Putting it to the test

1. Create a function called `getDecimals` that returns the result of the `decimals` function from the `AggregatorV3Interface`.
