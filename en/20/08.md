In this chapter, we’re going to deploy our smart contract to the Shasta test network, but before doing the deployment, some prep work is needed.

## Get some TRX

Make sure there is enough TRX in your account. The easiest way to get TRX for testing purposes is through a service known as a faucet. We recommend the <a href="https://www.trongrid.io/shasta" target=”_blank”>Shasta Faucet</a>. Follow the instructions, and within a few minutes, your address will be credited with some TRX.

## Put it to the test

1. Now that everything is set up, it's time to deploy to the Shasta test network. To do so, run `tronbox migrate --reset --network shasta` in the terminal to the right. Note how migrations are being executed in order😉.

> If you're curious about the `--reset` flag, it used to "tell" TronBox to run all your migrations. If you don't specify this flag and your migrations were previously run successfully, the `tronbox migrate` command runs only newly created migrations.

If everything goes well, you're going to see an output that's similar to the one to the right.
