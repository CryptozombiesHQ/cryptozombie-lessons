Deployment to the main net is not complicated at all, but make sure you test your smart contract first!

Once the smart contract is tested, you'll only have to run the `tronbox migrate command`, specifying that you want to migrate to the main net. Don't forget that you'll have to pay for gas! We trust you'll be able to do it.

## Put it to the test

1. To deploy your contract to the TRON main net, enter the `tronbox migrate --network mainnet` command in the box to the right.
