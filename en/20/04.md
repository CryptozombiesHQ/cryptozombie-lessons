Now that you've migrated your smart contracts to TRON, you'll learn how to compile them.

Why do we need to compile, you ask?

The TRON Virtual Machine can't directly run Solidity source code as you write it. Thus, you must use a compiler that "translates" your source code into machine-readable **_bytecode_**. The virtual machine then executes the bytecode, and completes the actions required by your smart contract.

When you compile your smart contracts, TronBox creates a separate JSON file for each contract in the `./build/contracts/` directory. These files contain all the information TronBox needs to deploy your smart contracts: the ABI, bytecode, and compiler version. Note that the names of the JSON files do not reflect the names of the source files but the name of your smart contracts.

These files are collectively named artifacts. They are integral to the inner workings of TronBox and play an important part in the successful deployment of your smart contracts. Do not edit these files, or TronBox might stop working correctly.

Enough talking. Let's put the compiler's powers to some good use!

## Put it to the test

Before you compile the smart contracts, ensure that you're using the `0.5.18` version of the Solidity compiler. To do so, open the `tronbox.js` file in a plain-text editor and modify the `compilers` section to this:

```json
compilers: {
  solc: {
    version: '0.5.18'
  }
}
```
1. Now you're ready to to compile your smart contracts. In the box to the right, enter the `tronbox compile` command.

2. Let's ensure that the build artifacts were created by entering the `tree ./build/contracts` command. The output should look similar to the following one:

```
./build/contracts
├── ERC721.json
├── Migrations.json
├── Ownable.json
├── SafeMath.json
├── ZombieAttack.json
├── ZombieFactory.json
├── ZombieFeeding.json
├── ZombieHelper.json
└── ZombieOwnership.json
```
