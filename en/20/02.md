            You should probably run `tronbox init` followed by `tree`.
        commands:
            "tronbox init":
                hint: tronbox init
                output: |

                    Unbox successful. Sweet!

                    Commands:

                    Compile:        tronbox compile
                    Migrate:        tronbox migrate
                    Test contracts: tronbox test

                    â”œâ”€â”€ migrations

Now that you've installed TronBox and TronWeb, let's initialize a new project by running the `tronbox init` command. This should create a set of folders and configuration files with the following structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts
    â”œâ”€â”€ Migrations.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations
    â”œâ”€â”€ 1_initial_migration.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ 2_deploy_contracts.js
â””â”€â”€ test
sample-env
tronbox-config.js
tronbox.js
```

Contracts, migrations, tests... this seems complicatedðŸ˜Ÿ


As you'll see in this chapter, this directory structure is straightforward and brings several important benefits. Let's take a closer look:

- **_contracts_**: The place where TronBox expects to find all your smart contracts. To keep the code organized, you can even create nested folders such as `contracts/tokens`. <!-- Note that running `tronbox init` created a smart contract named `Migrations.sol` and a corresponding migration file named `1_initial_migration`. We'll explain them a bit later. -->
- **_migrations_**: A directory containining a bunch of JavaScript files that provide all the necessary information and instructions for TronBox to deploy a smart contracts.
- **_test_**: The place where you should place your unit tests, which can be either JavaScript or Solidity files. Remember, once a contract is deployed, it can't be changed, making it essential that you test your smart contracts before you deploy them.

Now that we've shed some light on what these directories and files are, let's look at the benefits of using a standardized directory structure.

First and foremost, TronBox will not work as expected if you change the names of these directories or move the files around.

Second, using a standard directory structure and code convention makes it easier for other developers to understand your code.
## Put it to the test

1. To initialize a new project run the `tronbox init` command.

2. To make sure that the `tronbox init` command actually created all the files and folders explained above, enter the `tree` command. This will print your directory structure in the form of a tree.
