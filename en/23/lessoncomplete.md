Congratulations! That concludes Lesson 3.

## Let's recap:

- We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
- We've learned to protect core functions with `only_owner`
- We've learned about gas and gas optimization
- We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
- We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets above a certain level

Now that your Rust skills have greatly improved, it's time to prepare for zombie attacks. 

Lesson 4 awaits you!
