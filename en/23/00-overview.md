Grr... I just can't slow you down, can I? Your Rust skills are formidable, human...

Now that you've got some experience coding Rust under your belt, we're going to dive into some of the more technical aspects of MultiversX development.

This lesson will be a bit less flashy (sorry, no plot twists!). But you’ll learn some really important concepts that will take you closer to building real DApps — things like **contract ownership, gas costs, code optimization, and security**.

You've been warned — no kitties and rainbows in Lesson 3!

But a lot of densely-packed Rust knowledge. We strongly recommended that you complete Lesson 2 before starting this one.
