Up until now, Rust might have been a bit harder to deal with, and the syntax hard to get, but from this point we will experience what a strong programing language and a well designed framework can achieve when it comes to more complex elements for smart contract development and optimization.

Unlike on other blockchains, a contract deployed to MultiversX can be made upgradable and at some point, it will also be possible to undeploy it. While contracts can be made upgradable, this is not always enforced and may even be non-desirable in some cases.

But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do.

## External dependencies

In Lesson 2, we wrote a proxy for the CryproKitties contract and accessed it through an address from storage. Think of the consequences if we had hard-coded that address in our contract and at some point a bug would have been discovered in the CryptoKitties contract, leading to the destruction of all kitties.

It's unlikely, but if this did happen it would render our DApp completely useless — our DApp would point to a hardcoded address that no longer returned any kitties. Our zombies would be unable to feed on kitties, and we'd be unable to modify our contract to fix it unless we upgrade it.

For this reason, it often makes sense to have functions that will allow you to update key portions of the DApp.


## Put it to the test

Let's update our code from Lesson 2 to be able to change the CryptoKitties contract address.

1. Inside `lib.rs` create an endpoint `set_crypto_kitties_sc_address` that gets a `ManagedAddress` parameter called `address`.
2. Inside `set_crypto_kitties_sc_address` set the value of `crypto_kitties_sc_address` with `address`.

Be aware that we don't need to update to be able to set the value of an already set storage mapper if we are not interested in its current value.
