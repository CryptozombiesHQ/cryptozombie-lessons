Great! Now we know how to update key portions of the DApp while preventing other users from messing with our contracts.

Let's look at another way Rust is quite different from other programming languages.

## Gas — the fuel MultiversX DApps run on

On MultiversX, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp, via the concept of gas. They pay for the contract execution with EGLD (the currency on MultiversX), an amount proportional with the amount of computation required to carry out the operation.

How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a **_gas cost_** based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total **_gas cost_** of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimisation is much more important in writing smart contracts than regular application in any programming language. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

## Why is gas necessary?

MultiversX is like a big, extremely secure computer, relatively fast as blockchains go, but slower than a regular computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes MultiversX decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.

The creators of MultiversX wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.

## Numeric types

In Lesson 1, we mentioned that there are other types of unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, etc.

Using the right type per context in MultiversX Rust framework is important because of how the contracts are optimised in allocating just the right amount of space, without overallocating.

Specific to MultiversX Rust framework there is another numeric type called `BigUint` generaly used in MultiversX Rust contracts for amounts of crypto currency and not only.

## Put it to the test

In this lesson, we're going to add 2 new features to our zombies: `level` and `ready_time` — the latter will be used to implement a cooldown timer to limit how often a zombie can feed.

So let's jump back to `zombie.rs`.

1. Add two more properties to our `Zombie` struct: `level` (an `u16`), and `ready_time` (an `u64`).
