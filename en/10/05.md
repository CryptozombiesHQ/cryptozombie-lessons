Awesome! You've successfully compiled the source code and created a migration file.

There is still one more thing to do before we can deploy. We'll have to edit the configuration file to tell _Truffle_ the networks we want to deploy to.

Wait a minute, I thought there was only one **_Ethereum_** network. What am I missing here?

## Ethereum Test Networks

There are several public **_Ethereum_** test networks that let you test your contracts for free before you deploy them to the main net (remember once you deploy a contract to the main net it can't be altered). These test networks use a different consensus algorithm to the mainnet (usually PoA), and Ether is free to encourage thorough testing.

In this lesson, we will be using **_Rinkeby_**, a public test network created by The Ethereum Foundation.

## truffle.js

Now, let's take a look at the default _Truffle_ configuration file:

```bash
$ cat truffle.js
/*
 * NB: since truffle-hdwallet-provider 0.0.5 you must wrap HDWallet providers in a
 * function when declaring them. Failure to do so will cause commands to hang. ex:
 *
 * mainnet: {
 *     provider: function() {
 *       return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, 'https://mainnet.infura.io/<infura-key>')
 *     },
 *     network_id: '1',
 *     gas: 4500000,
 *     gasPrice: 10000000000,
 *   },
 */
```

It is just an empty shell. Thus, we'll be required to update this file to allow us to deploy contracts to Rinkeby and the Ethereum mainnet.

### Truffle's HD Wallet Provider

Remember the second chapter?

We asked you to install an additional package called `truffle-hdwallet-provider` that helps _Truffle_ sign transactions.

Now, we want to edit our configuration file to use `HDWalletProvider`. To get this to work we'll add a line at the top of the file:

```JavaScript
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
```

Next, we'll create a new variable to store our mnemonic:

```JavaScript
var mnemonic = "onions carrots beans ...";
```

Note that we don't recommend storing secrets like a mnemonic or a private key in a configuration file.

...but why?

Config files are often pushed to GitHub, where anyone can see them, leaving you wide open to attack ðŸ˜±! To avoid revealing your mnemonic (or your private key!), you should read it from an environment variable.

**To keep things simple in this case**, we've copied the mnemonic and stored in a variable.

### Set up Truffle for Rinkeby and mainnet

Next, to make sure _Truffle_ "knows" the networks we want to deploy to, we will have to create two separate objects- one for _Rinkeby_ and the other one for _main net_:

```JavaScript
networks: {
  // Configuration for mainnet
  mainnet: {
    provider: function () {
      // Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
      return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
    },
    network_id: "1"
  },
  // Configuration for rinkeby network
  rinkeby: {
    // Special function to setup the provider
    provider: function () {
      // Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
      return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
    },
    // Network id is 4 for Rinkeby
    network_id: 4
  }
```

>Note: the provider value is wrapped in a function, which ensures that it won't get initialized until it's needed.

### Wrapping it up

Now, let's put these piece together and have a look at how our config file should look:

```JavaScript
// Initialize HDWalletProvider
const HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");

// Set your own mnemonic here
const mnemonic = "YOUR_MNEMONIC";

// Module exports to make this configuration available to Truffle itself
module.exports = {
  // Object with configuration for each network
  networks: {
    // Configuration for mainnet
    mainnet: {
      provider: function () {
        // Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
      },
      network_id: "1"
    },
    // Configuration for rinkeby network
    rinkeby: {
      // Special function to setup the provider
      provider: function () {
        // Setting the provider with the Infura Rinkeby address and Token
        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_TOKEN")
      },
      // Network id is 4 for Rinkeby
      network_id: 4
    }
  }
};
```

# Put it to the test:

1. Copy the above configuration to `truffle.js`. Use it to replace the existing content.
