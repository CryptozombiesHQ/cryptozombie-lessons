Remember that we promised to teach you how to deploy a smart contract?

It's been a while, but the time has come!

In this lesson, we will be teaching you how to deploy to **_Ethereum_** using **_Truffle_**.

And this is not all. You are going to learn how to deploy your smart contracts to **_Loom_** as wellðŸ˜Ž.

Why deploy to **_Loom_**? After all, **_Ethereum_** is the most secure network.

Yes, we totally agree with that. But on Ethereum each transaction costs _gas_, so your users will have to pay fees for each and every transaction. Also, they will have to wait at least 10 seconds for each transaction to be confirmed.

In a nutshell, **_on Ethereum, all transactions benefit from the same security guarantees_**. For something like a user-facing DApp or a game, this level of security isn't always a requirement. In fact, it just harms the user experience.

On **_Loom_**, users have access to much speedier and gas-free transactions. This makes **_Loom_** a much better fit for something like a game or a user-facing DApp.

Enough talking! Let's get startedðŸ˜‰
