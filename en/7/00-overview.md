Welcome, veteran CryptoZombie!

In this course, we are going to venture into the land of real game development.

You will be building a *custom game mode* for our blockchain-based mobile card game, <a href="https://loom.games" target=_blank>Zombie Battleground</a>. 

**Once you complete this course, youâ€™ll have the skillset to build your own mod of Zombie Battleground**. Very soon we'll be launching a custom game creator tool, and you'll be able to deploy these mods to Loom GameChain, where they will be immediately playable by thousands of real Zombie Battleground players.

Pretty cool, right?

Okay, let's start building the next great Ethereum game- Aliens vs Zombies!ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

If youâ€™re readyâ€¦ Then letâ€™s dive right in and build your first mod!
