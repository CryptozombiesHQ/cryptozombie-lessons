**_//TODO: maybe add some cards to the right?_**

Congratulations! That concludes Lesson 7.

## Let's recap:

In this lesson we learned about:

- Multi fungible tokens, and the ERC721X standard
- How to build a faucet that mints, let users claim, and transfers tokens
- How to use ERC721X to implement unique, limited edition, and standard edition cards

This lesson concludes the first part of our Aliens vs Zombies Game! We'll add more lessons in the future.
