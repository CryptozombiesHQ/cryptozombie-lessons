Congrats! You've just created your very first game mod for Zombie Battleground!

This lesson was intended to get you familiar with all the syntax behind custom game modes, and showing you what types of changes are possible.

In Lesson 2, we'll be looking at some more realistic game modes — where we apply some custom rules to deck selection, such as:

1. Players can only use cards that cost less than 2 goo

2. Players cannot have duplicate cards in their deck

3. Before the match, both players' decks are shuffled together, and then distributed back randomly (so each player ends up with a mix of his cards and his opponents').

In the very very near future, we'll be launching a "Zombie Battleground Custom Game Creator" tool, which you can use to deploy your own custom game modes directly to Loom GameChain — and every Zombie Battleground player will be able to load your game mode and start playing it!

We'll let you know as soon as the game creator tool goes live.

But in the meantime, you can proceed to Lesson 2 — and become expert by the time we roll it out!
