Great! Now we know how to update key portions of the DApp while preventing other users from messing with our contracts.

Let's look at another way Rust is quite different from other programming languages:

## Gas — the fuel MultiversX DApps run on

In Rust, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called **_gas_**. Users buy gas with EGLD (the currency on MultiversX), so your users have to spend EGLD in order to execute functions on your DApp. 

How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a **_gas cost_** based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total **_gas cost_** of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in MultiversX than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

## Why is gas necessary?
<!-- 
Multivers is like a big, slow, but extremely secure computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes Ethereum decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.

The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.

> Note: This isn't necessarily true for other blockchain, like the ones the CryptoZombies authors are building at Loom Network. It probably won't ever make sense to run a game like World of Warcraft directly on the Ethereum mainnet — the gas costs would be prohibitively expensive. But it could run on a blockchain with a different consensus algorithm. We'll talk more about what types of DApps you would want to deploy on Loom vs the Ethereum mainnet in a future lesson. -->

## numeric types

In Lesson 1, we mentioned that there are other types of unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, etc.

Using the right type per context in MultiversX Rust framework is importand because of how they try to optimize the contracts by allocating just the right amount of space, without overallocating.

Specific to MultiversX Rust framework there is another numeric type very specific called `BigUint`.
BigUint is simply a handle to the actual representation, similar to how system file handles work, so it's simply a struct with an `i32` as member, representing the handle. All the operations have to be done through API functions, passing the handles for result, first operand, second operand. Using Rust's operator overloading feature, we're able to overwrite arithmetic operators and provide an easy way of adding BigUints, just like primitive number types.

## Put it to the test

In this lesson, we're going to add 2 new features to our zombies: `level` and `ready_time` — the latter will be used to implement a cooldown timer to limit how often a zombie can feed. 

So let's jump back to `zombie.rs`.

1. Add two more properties to our `Zombie` struct: `level` (an `u16`), and `ready_time` (an `u64`).
