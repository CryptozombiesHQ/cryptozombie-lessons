Great! Now we know how to update key portions of the DApp while preventing other users from messing with our contracts.

Let's look at another way Solidity is quite different from other programming languages:

## Gas — the fuel Ethereum DApps run on

In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called **_gas_**. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp. 

How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a **_gas cost_** based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total **_gas cost_** of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

## Why is gas necessary?

Ethereum is like a big, slow, but extremely secure computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes Ethereum decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.

The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.

> Note: This isn't necessarily true for other blockchain, like the ones the CryptoZombies authors are building at Loom Network. It probably won't ever make sense to run a game like World of Warcraft directly on the Ethereum mainnet — the gas costs would be prohibitively expensive. But it could run on a blockchain with a different consensus algorithm. We'll talk more about what types of DApps you would want to deploy on Loom vs the Ethereum mainnet in a future lesson.

## Struct packing to save gas

In Lesson 1, we mentioned that there are other types of `uint`s: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, etc.

Normally there's no benefit to using these sub-types because Solidity reserves 256 bits of storage regardless of the `uint` size. For example, using `uint8` instead of `uint` (`uint256`) won't save you any gas.

But there's an exception to this: inside `struct`s.

If you have multiple `uint`s inside a struct, using a smaller-sized `uint` when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage. For example:

```
struct NormalStruct {
  uint a;
  uint b;
  uint c;
}

struct MiniMe {
  uint32 a;
  uint32 b;
  uint c;
}

// `mini` will cost less gas than `normal` because of struct packing
NormalStruct normal = NormalStruct(10, 20, 30);
MiniMe mini = MiniMe(10, 20, 30); 
```

For this reason, inside a struct you'll want to use the smallest integer sub-types you can get away with.

You'll also want to cluster identical data types together (i.e. put them next to each
other in the struct) so that Solidity can minimize the required storage space. For example, a struct with
fields `uint c; uint32 a; uint32 b;` will cost less gas than a struct with fields `uint32 a; uint c; uint32 b;`
because the `uint32` fields are clustered together.


## Put it to the test

In this lesson, we're going to add 2 new features to our zombies: `level` and `readyTime` — the latter will be used to implement a cooldown timer to limit how often a zombie can feed. 

So let's jump back to `zombiefactory.sol`.

1. Add two more properties to our `Zombie` struct: `level` (a `uint32`), and `readyTime` (also a `uint32`). We want to pack these data types together, so let's put them at the end of the struct.

32 bits is more than enough to hold the zombie's level and timestamp, so this will save us some gas costs by packing the data more tightly than using a regular `uint` (256-bits).
