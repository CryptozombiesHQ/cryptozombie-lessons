Up until now, Rust might have been a bit harder to deal with and the syntax hard to get, but fro this point we will experience what a strong programing language and a well designed framework can achieve when it comes to more complex elements for smart contract development and optimization. 

To start with, after you deploy a contract to MultiversX, compared with other blockchains it is upgradable and hopefully one day soon manageable through versioning and even undeployable. Of course all these features come at a very complex syntax as you have seen by now, but as uncle be once told Peter: "With great power comes great responsability".

But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do.

## External dependencies

In Lesson 2, we stored made a proxy for the CtyproKitties contract and accessed it through an address that we stored within the storage. Imagine how would it looked like if we hard codded that address straigth up in the contract and what would happen if the CryptoKitties contract had a bug and someone destroyed all the kitties?

It's unlikely, but if this did happen it would render our DApp completely useless — our DApp would point to a hardcoded address that no longer returned any kitties. Our zombies would be unable to feed on kitties, and we'd be unable to modify our contract to fix it.

For this reason, it often makes sense to have functions that will allow you to update key portions of the DApp.


## Put it to the test

Let's update our code from Lesson 2 to be able to change the CryptoKitties contract address.

1. Inside `lib.rs` create an endpoint `set_crypto_kitties_sc_address` that gets a `ManagedAddress` parameter called `address` and sets the value of `crypto_kitties_sc_address`. Be aware that we don't need to cann update to set the value of an already set storage mapper if we are not interested of its current value.
