Congratulations! That concludes Lesson 3.

## Let's recap:

- We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
- We've learned to protect core functions with `onlyOwner`
- We've learned about gas and gas optimization
- We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
- We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets above a certain level
- And finally, we now have a function to return a user's zombie army

## Claim your reward

As a reward for completing Lesson 3, both of your zombies have leveled up!

And now that NoName (the kitty-zombie you created in Lesson 2), is upgraded to level 2, you can call `changeName` to give him/her a name. NoName no more!

Go ahead and give NoName a name, then proceed to the next chapter to complete the lesson.
