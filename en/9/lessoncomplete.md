## Congratulations! You've now implemented your first ERC721x token.

This was just an example implementation — there are many different design decisions you could make with your token contract depending on the type of items you want to have in your game, and how you want your players to receive and interact with them.

We've looked at how to have items with infinite supply as well as rare items with a fixed supply; how to control who, how, and when new items can be minted; how users will receive the items; and how the items can be converted to be backward compatible with legacy ERC721 services.

You can change the way some of these functions work depending on your needs.

### Next Steps

For implementing ERC721x in your next project, go ahead and head over to our open source implementation on <a href="https://github.com/loomnetwork/erc721x" target=_blank>GitHub</a>.

You can follow the instructions there to add it to your project, and start using it with an example implementation just like we did in this lesson.
