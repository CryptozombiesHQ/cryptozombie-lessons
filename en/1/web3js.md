Our Solidity contract is complete! Now we need to write a javascript frontend that interacts with the contract.

Ethereum has a Javascript library called **_Web3.js_**.

In a later lesson, we'll go over in depth how to deploy a contract and set up Web3.js. But for now let's just look at some sample code for how Web3.js would interact with our deployed contract.

Don't worry if this doesn't all make sense yet.

```
// Here's how we would access our contract:
var abi = /* abi generated by the compiler */
var ZombieFactoryContract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var contractAddress = /* our contract address on Ethereum after deploying */
var ZombieFactory = ZombieFactoryContract.at(contractAddress)
// `ZombieFactory` has access to our contract's public functions and events

// some sort of event listener to take the text input:
$("#ourButton").click(function(e) {
  var name = $("#nameInput").val()
  // Call our contract's `createPseudoRandomZombie` function:
  ZombieFactory.createPseudoRandomZombie(name)
})

// Listen for the `NewZombie` event, and update the UI
var event = ZombieFactory.NewZombie(function(error, result) {
  if (error) return
  generateZombie(result.zombieId, result.name, result.dna)
})

// take the Zombie dna, and update our image
function generateZombie(id, name, dna) {
  let dnaStr = String(dna)
  // pad DNA with leading zeroes if it's less than 16 characters
  while (dnaStr.length < 16)
    dnaStr = "0" + dnaStr

  let zombieDetails = {
    // first 2 digits make up the head. We have 7 possible heads, so % 7
    // to get a number 0 - 6, then add 1 to make it 1 - 7. Then we have 7
    // image files named "head1.png" through "head7.png" we load based on
    // this number:
    headChoice: dnaStr.substring(0, 2) % 7 + 1,
    // 2nd 2 digits make up the eyes, 11 variations:
    eyeChoice: dnaStr.substring(2, 4) % 11 + 1,
    // 6 variations of shirts:
    shirtChoice: dnaStr.substring(4, 6) % 6 + 1,
    // last 6 digits control color. Updated using CSS filter: hue-rotate
    // which has 360 degrees:
    skinColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(6, 8) / 100 * 360),
    eyeColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(8, 10) / 100 * 360),
    clothesColorChoice: parseInt(dnaStr.substring(10, 12) / 100 * 360),
    zombieName: name,
    zombieDescription: "A Level 1 CryptoZombie",
  }
  return zombieDetails
}
```

What our javascript then does is take the values generated in `zombieDetails` above, and use some browser-based javascript magic (we're using Vue.js) to swap out the images and apply CSS filters. You'll get all the code for this in a later lesson.
