Great job! Now that we've got a shell for our contract, let's learn about how Solidity deals with variables.

**_State variables_** are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB.

##### Example:
```
contract Example {
  // This will be stored permanently in the blockchain
  uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
}
```

In this example contract, we created a `uint` called `myUnsignedInteger` and set it equal to 100.

## Unsigned Integers: `uint`

The `uint` data type is an unsigned integer, meaning **its value must be non-negative**. There's also an `int` data type for signed integers.

> Note: In Solidity, `uint` is actually an alias for `uint256`, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits â€” `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, etc.. But in general you want to simply use `uint` except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

# Put it to the test

Our Zombie DNA is going to be determined by a 16-digit number.

Declare a `uint` named `dnaDigits`, and set it equal to `16`.
