The time has come, human...

Time to make your zombies FIGHT!

But zombie battles aren't for the faint of heart...

In this lesson, we're going to be putting together a lot of the concepts you've learned in previous chapters to build out a zombie battle function. We're also going to learn about **payable** functions, and how to build DApps that can accept money from players.
