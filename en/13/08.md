While strolling along the Nile, you’ve encountered a robber, and he has requested you pay 1 BNB in order to continue or else you must fight for your life! His address is “tbnb000000000000000000000000”.

How do you send transfers? You can do it with just one command:

```
tbnbcli send --from testKey --to tbnb000000000000000000000000 --amount 100000000:BNB --chain-id=Binance-Chain-Nile --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80 --memo "Spare my life!"
```

[You’ve successfully got pass the Robber! Exp + 100]

Are we moving too fast? Let's take a few moments to slow down and take a look into all these parameters:

* `--from`: This is the part of the command that you tell it which wallet of yours you are using (because you can have many).  In our example, we're using wallet A so we're passing it `testkey`.
* `--to`: this is the destination of your transfer. You HAVE to put in a valid Binance chain address.
* `--amount`: Because the Binance chain has a native concept of tokens, the amount is specified in two parts: the quantity:the token name. This is dramatically different from Bitcoin, where you can only send BTC, and from Ethereum, where tokens mean interacting with smart contracts. The quantity is expressed as int8, which means 1 BNB should be written with 8 decimal precision as 10000000.
* `--memo`: This is a feature of the Binance chain that lets you add an extra bit of information to tag along. Much like when you do wire transfers, you can put in a memo to the bank. This field is optional most of  the time  but essential when specific memos are required for the receiver to process your transfer. Like when you transfer assets from Binance chain to Loom’s basechain (or Ethereum), you need to input a secondary destination in the memo for the transfer gateway.

## Put it to the test

1. Use the “send” function to transfer 1 BNB to  the address tbnb1111111111111111111111111111. Don’t forget that the Binance coin has 8 decimals.
