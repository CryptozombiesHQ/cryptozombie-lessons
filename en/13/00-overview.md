Hey there, have you been reading our newsletter lately?

If not, here's the thing: we've been very busy building the best multichain network. So far, we've added support for Ethereum, Tron, and Binance. And more chains are on the roadmapðŸ˜‰.

Why is this important, you ask?

Well, integrating with the major blockchains gets your DApp exposed to the user base of all these chains combined. Moreover, you'll be able to accept a multitude of tokens as payment.

Thus, if you choose to build your app **_Loom_**, you simply get to spend more time coding your awesome DApp.

Now let's talk a bit about the Binance and BEP-2 tokens.

**What is the BEP-2 standard?**

Good question! To answer it, I copied an pasted the following definition from the BEP-2 GitHub web page: "_The BEP2 standard describes a set of rules for token management within the Binance Chain ecosystem._"

This is useful. But let me add something at least equally important. _Binance chain doesnâ€™t provide support for smart contracts... but Loom does_. This allows you, as a developer, to build all sorts of cool stuff such as decentralized token swap service, a multi-collateral stable coin and so on and so forth.

But first things first. In this lesson, we'll show you how to create a BEP-2 Token on the Binance chain.

Let's get started!
