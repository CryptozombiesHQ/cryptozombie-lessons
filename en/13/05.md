Great job! Now that you've imported your wallet locally, I'll show you how to issue your first BEP-2 token.

[Level up! You gained a new ability. Token Creation]

Ethereum popularized the concept of letting 3rd parties create tokens on a blockchain, but it meant writing smart contracts, testing them, auditing them. We cover this topic from beginning to end in our Solidity paths:

* <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity" target=_blank>Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contracts</a>
* <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity_advanced" target=_blank>Advanced Solidity: Get In-depth Knowledge</a>

The Binance chain, as a specialty chain built to enable tokens and trading does this one better. Tokens are **first class citizens** on the Binance chain, which means that `YourSpecialToken` or `YetAnotherToken` is treated the same as the BNB token: they have the same interface, the same security, and creating them requires no additional smart contracts. If Ethereum lets you create a reasonable token under a day, on the Binance chain, it literally takes a few minutes.

[Ding! You’ve received some testnet gold, prepare your wallet]

## It's Time to Play Some Trivia 

To continue, answer this question: is the Tigris longer than the Nile?

It doesn't really matter, I'm just kidding. Let's get back to our lesson.

Before it’s safe for you to play around in the real world (Mainnet), you can learn the ropes in Nile, where everything  is safe. Hmm…? I see you are confused, let me start from the basics and get you set up.

Nile is the name of the Binance Chain testnet. A testnet is usually a technical clone of the main blockchain (mainnet is called Tigris) where you can play around, test, debug, and experiment without using real money and causing real harm. Often, technical upgrades to the chain get tested on testnets before they’re available in mainnet. But while Nile runs the same software as the Tigris, it doesn’t have the same state, or in simpler terms, the data is completely different. We’ll get to that distinction later.

But what information do I need to supply to issue a token on the Binance chain?

Good question! To issue a token, you must run the `tbnbcli token issue` command followed by these parameters:

* `--from`: with the name of your private key. This will make you the issuer. And yes, you're going to own all the tokens😀.
* `--token-name`: with the name of the token (max 32 characters).
* `--symbol`: with the symbol of your token (max 8 characters). You don't need to worry about being unique. Binance automatically appends a 3 letters suffix to make sure it's unique.
* `--total-supply`: with an `int64` specifying the total supply boosted by 1e8 for the decimal part. Its value can't exceed 90 billion.
* `--mintable`: this is an optional parameter you can use to specify that you want to mint more tokens at some point in the future.
* `--chain-id`:  with `Binance-Chain-Nile` for the test net and `Binance-Chain-Tigris` for the main net.
* `--node`: with the address on the endpoint. In this lesson, we'll be using `data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80`. Refer to <a href="https://testnet-dex.binance.org/api/v1/peers" target=”_blank”> this page</a> for the list of the available endpoints for the test net.
* `--trust-node`: the client will trust the full node to which it connects.

## Example

```bash
tbnbcli token issue --token-name "My Great Token" --total-supply 100000000000000000 --symbol "MGT" --mintable --from testKey --chain-id=Binance-Chain-Nile --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80 --trust-node
```

In the above example, we're issuing a token named "My Great Token" with an initial supply of 1 billion. Then, we specify its symbol- "MGT", and make it mintable.

This looks pretty simple, right? Ready to give it a shot?

## Put it to the test

1. Issue a token called "My Awesome Token". Make it so that the initial supply is 2 billion and set its symbol to "MAT". Almost forgot... let's make it mintable.

Again, you'll be asked to type the password that protects your key. Since our command-line interpreter is pretty basic, we'll just have to skip this part.

Take a few seconds and to check the output. Can you find the symbol Binance assigned to our newly issued token?🧐

Let me help you out, since your new to this stuff. The symbol is `MAT-2A5`.

> Note: The Nile is probably the longest river in the world.
