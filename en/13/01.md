Before we get into the meat and potatoes, let's talk a bit about the types of tokens that live on the Binance chain.

First, there are **_BNB_** tokens. The BNB token is the native token on the Binance chain and all fees are paid in BNB.

Then, there are **_BEP-2_** tokens. As long as you pay the fee, you can freely issue a BEP-2 token. There are no restrictions.

## What exactly is a BEP-2 Token?

Good question! To answer it, I copied and pasted the following definition from the BEP-2 GitHub web page: 


_The BEP2 standard describes a set of rules for token  management within the Binance Chain ecosystem. It introduces the following details of a token on Binance Chain:_

* _What information makes a token on Binance Chain_
* _What actions can be performed on a token on Binance Chain_


This is useful. But let me add something at least equally important. **_The Binance chain doesn't provide support for smart contracts... but Loom does_**. This allows you, as a developer, to build all sorts of cool stuff such as a decentralized token swap service, a multi-collateral stable coin and so on and so forth.

Now let's get back to why we're here. To issue a BEP-2 token, you must pay a fee of 500 BNB tokens.

So before delving into the details of how BEP-2 tokens work, let's make sure there are enough BNB tokens in your account. The way to get BNB tokens is through the Binance testnet faucet. All you have to do is to point your browser to the faucet, type the address of your wallet, and wait a few minutes for Binance to send the funds to your address.

It sounds straightforward, but there's a catch. The faucet credits each wallet with 200 testnet BNB tokens. This means that we must create at least three wallets to get enough BNB tokens for our purposes.

That said, before moving forward with this lesson, you must get at least 500 testnet BNB tokens by following these steps:

* If you don't have a Binance account, follow the instructions on the 
<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register" target=”_blank”> Binance Register page </a> to create one.

* Next, go to <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/create" target=”_blank”> this page </a> and create three Binance testnet wallets. Let's call them A, B, and C. Download the keystore files and give them some meaningful names such as keystore_a, keystore_b, and keystore_c. Also, don't forget to save the mnemonics somewhere safe. We'll need them in the next chapter.

* Head over to the <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/unlock" target=”_blank”> Unlock page </a> and unlock wallet A. This will take you the Binance DEX main page. Select your account from the top menu bar and copy your address. Next, paste it into a new document.

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-grab-your-address.png" alt="Get Your Address" height="253" width="469">

* Repeat the step from above for wallet B and then for wallet C.

* At this point, you are ready to get yourself some BNB testnet tokens. Go to the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/dex/testnet/address" target=”_blank”> Binance testnet faucet</a> and paste your addresses.

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-binance-faucet.png" alt="Binance Faucet" height="253" width="469">

* Once finished, click the Submit button. This will credit each wallet with 200 testnet BNB tokens.

* Now, what's left to do is to transfer the BNB testnet tokens from wallet B and C to wallet A. Let's unlock wallet B. Head over to the <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/unlock" target=”_blank”> Unlock page </a>. Next, upload the keystore file and then type the password. This will redirect you to the Binance testnet home page. From the top menu bar select Balances and then click Send.

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-send-bnb.png" alt="Send BNB" height="253" width="469">

* Fill in the input box with the address of the wallet A and make sure you send all the tokens by clicking the Max button.

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-send-asset.png" alt="Send Asset" height="253" width="469">

* Now, confirm the transaction details and the tokens will be transferred to wallet A.

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-confirm-transaction.png" alt="Confirm Transaction" height="253" width="469">

* Repeat the process for wallet C.

Hooray! At this point, wallet A should hold 600 BNB tokens.

## True power at your fingertips

Whenever you hear people speak about blockchains, they mention “devs” in hushed voices. To a mere user, a dev has mysterious powers - the ability to connect directly to a blockchain without going through a middleman, to see into the inner workings of the chains and unravel its mysteries, and when devs turn to the dark side, funds are not SAFU.

This lesson is about teaching you all of that (minus the dark side), to show you the inner workings and fundamental concepts of the Binance chain, not as a mere user but as a dev with true power at your fingertips.

[You have discovered the Binace chain CLI, Exp +100 ]

The CLI or command-line interface, is how we’ll be walking through the workings and functionalities of the Binance chain. On your right, we have a fully simulated terminal. The CLI is a program that runs in the terminal, and you are  able to interact with it by typing commands. It lets you manage your keys, send transactions, issue tokens, transfer them, and many more.

To install the Binance chain CLI on your computer, you need to clone a GitHub repository by entering something like the following:

```bash
git clone <repository-address>
```

## Put it to the test

Fire up a new terminal, then `cd` to the directory where you want to save this project.

1. Clone the `https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary.git` repository.

Ugh... cloning the `node-binary` repository failed.

Let's find out why by taking a closer look at the output.

See this line?

```bash
git-lfs filter-process: git-lfs: command not found`
```

Git Large File Storage or `git-lfs` is a Git extension meant to help with versioning large files. The issue is that `git-lfs` is not installed on your system. We've gone ahead and installed it by following <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/" target=”_blank”> these steps</a>. Then, we ran `cd node-binary/`.

2. Retry the checkout by running the `git checkout -f HEAD` command.
