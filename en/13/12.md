Many of the popular dexes that exist now are built using smart contracts running on layer 1 like Ethereum. Because of this, they are limited by the nature of smart contracts, namely complex computation is very expensive  and storage is extremely limited. So the most common pattern developers have chosen is to have the fund management part of the exchange on Ethereum/EOS/Tron, while keeping the order book, order matching and execution portion off Ethereum and on their own servers. As you can probably guess, it’s simply not as decentralized as when everything is on the blockchain, and that’s the design of  the Binance Dex.

The Binance Dex is a fully native decentralized exchange, meaning the logic of it is baked into the blockchain, the same way transfers are baked into Bitcoin. It’s a first class citizen so to speak. Order matching happens within the nodes, and all the order execution also happens on the chain itself. This offers several real advantages:

1. If a bug exists or a catastrophic vulnerability occurs on a regular smart contract based DEX, the chain itself is very unlikely to fork to revert the damage. Whereas the Binance Dex is the chain, and so it is most likely going to fork to undo catastrophic damages. 
2. When all the orders and matching and executions are on the blockchain, it turns it into an auditable ledger. This lets users protect themselves from biased and malicious order matching engines, fake order books, and makes it easier to detect front running. 

You can look at your orders like this:

```
tbnbcli dex show -l MAT-2A5_BNB  --chain-id Binance-Chain-Nile --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80
```

You can also look at the orders of everyone else as well, because everything is executing on the chain. To do so, take a look at the block explorer: https://testnet-explorer.binance.org/

## Put it to the test

1. View your current orders
2. Cancel the MAT-2A5_BNB order.

> Note that you can cancel any orders like this: `tbnbcli dex cancel --symbol symbolname --refid orderid. The refid is the order id, yours is 813E4939F1567B219704FFC2AD4DF58BDE010879-30`.
