Congratulations! You've finished settings up `bnbcli` on your machine. Now we're going to show you to configure it so you can use it on your computer.

## Words of Magic

When you created your wallet in the first chapter, you also acquired 24 words of magic that look like this:

_shrug crater public section jar total reveal car flame print scare remind battle science cross assist rocket asset mention enhance razor cabbage body someone_

These 24 words are like incantations of a spell, but the effect of the spell...is “open sesame”. It’s the passphrase that opens your vault, and lets anyone access all your riches. If you feel like sharing, email your passphrase to takemymoney@cleverflare.com. Otherwise don’t tell another soul.

If the words are incantations, the actual spell is an extremely complicated process which consists of two main parts. Let's break them down:

* **BIP-39**  is a way to generate a binary seed from 24 words. BIP-39 stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal #39. Despite the alien sounding acronym, it’s a very simple and easy to understand concept. There’s a list of agreed upon words, which are specifically chosen to avoid confusion like “woman” and “women”. The words you have are then salted and put through an algorithm to produce a random looking seed. But it’s not random, the same words always result in the same seed.
* From the seed, we then feed it into an **elliptic curve** (fancy cryptography) and a few other algorithms to produce your final address. Not all elliptic curves are the same, and Binance uses the same as Bitcoin - secp256k1. But there’s a lot of processing  that happens and just because the curve is the same, it doesn’t mean your address will be the same on  Binance and Bitcoin.

At this point, you are probably asking why do you need these magic words.

Well, you'll be using them to import wallet A by recovering it from these magic words (also known as mnemonic).

As with Ethereum and probably any other blockchain, the Binance chain uses a private key to make sure that you signed a specific transaction. As long as no one else knows your private key, there's no risk that someone could submit a fake transaction on your behalf. Importing wallet A basically means that the CLI will be able to sign transactions on your behalf using your private key.

## Importing Your Wallet with a Mnemonic Phrase

The way this works is that you must execute the `tbnbcli keys add` command and pass it the following arguments:

* the name of the key
* the `--recover` flag

Example:

```bash
tbnbcli keys add myKey --recover
```

That's enough theory! Time to get your hands dirty.

## Put it to the test

1. Write a script that moves a BEP-2 token between the Binance chain, Loom, and Ethereum. Lighten up, I'm just joking😉. We'll likely show you how to do that in later lessons. But, before we get there, let's just recover wallet A.  The key should be called `testKey` and don't forget the `--recover` flag!


First, you will be required to type a passphrase to protect your key. Then, you'll have to enter your recovery seed phrase:

```bash
Enter a passphrase for your key:
Repeat the passphrase:
> Enter your recovery seed phrase:
```

Our command-line interpreter is pretty basic, so we'll have to skip this part. Just keep in mind that the recovery seed phrase is the mnemonic phrase.

## Did you know?

The same 24 words can be used to generate addresses in many chains and they’ll all be different! Even if the same elliptic curve is used, and Gen 2 chains like Loom often uses newer and more efficient elliptic curves. You can try it for yourself <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target=”_blank”>here</a>.
If you wanted to use the same key cross chains and send tokens, the only solution is <a href="https://loomx.io/developers/en/how-to-get-started.html#to-get-started-with-universal-transaction-signing" target=”_blank”>universal-signing</a> as part of Loom network’s interoperability.
