We're almost finished here. There's one more thing we would like to teach you- how to check that you've successfully issued and minted your BEP-2 tokens.

## The Binance Chain Explorer (Testnet)

Binance provides an easy-to-use block explorer. To check if everything went well, just point your browser to <a href="https://testnet-explorer.binance.org/" target=”_blank”> this address</a>. Next, type the symbol of your token in the search bar:

Once you're done, press Enter and you will be redirected to a page similar to this one:

<img src="/course/static/image/lesson-13/token-details.png" alt="Token details" height="253" width="469">

As you can see there are two transactions:
* First, we issued our BEP2-token
* Next, we minted additional tokens

Let's get more details about the first transactions by clicking on it:

## Checking balances using the bnbcli command-line utility

You can check balances by running the `tbnbcli` command-line utility and passing it your address. For example, to check the balance for `tbnb178zcz9nhuufdtk7esy22rel5k8zpsvqelr596w` (this is the address we've used in this tutorial), you would want to run something like the following:

```
tbnbcli account tbnb178zcz9nhuufdtk7esy22rel5k8zpsvqelr596w --chain-id=Binance-Chain-Nile --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80 --trust-node
```

The comamnd takes a few seconds to run. Then, it'll print out to the console your balance:

```
{"type":"bnbchain/Account","value":{"base":{"address":"tbnb178zcz9nhuufdtk7esy22rel5k8zpsvqelr596w","coins":[{"denom":"BNB","amount":"11652748500"},{"denom":"MAT-2A5","amount":"300000000000000000"}],"public_key":{"type":"tendermint/PubKeySecp256k1","value":"Aukd8YfaYyOM8G2bDzocZJ9+7mA/Ro5WWa8hIYpry7Nj"},"account_number":"679087","sequence":"39"},"name":"","frozen":null,"locked":null,"flags":"0"}}
```

Hmmm... wouldn't be nice if we could make this output a bit prettier?

So, one of the most useful tools for when you're dealing with JSON files is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" target=”_blank”> jq</a>. 

It's a lightweight command-line JSON processor and it provides tons of useful features. Anyway, for the scope of this tutorial, we'll just `pipe` the output through `jq`.

>Note: Here's how you can `pipe` a command through `jq`: `command1 | jq`. If you run this command, the output of `command1` will become the input of `jq`.

## Put it to the test

1. Pipe the command that checks your balance through `jq`.

(Hint: you should run something like this: `tbnbcli account ... | jq`)
