At this point, you're going to want to make sure that your key was successfully imported. This is as simple as entering the following command:

```bash
tbnbcli keys list
```

## Put it to the test

>Note: Every wallet on the Binance testnet begins with the letters “tbnb”, or “bnb” on the Binance mainnet. That’s how you know you’re in the Binance world and not Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s a safety feature left by the devs to prevent users from performing irreversible actions to addresses that are incompatible.
