Now that we've cloned the `node-binary` repository, your directory structure looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ cli
  â”œâ”€â”€ prod
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0.6.2
      â”œâ”€â”€ linux
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
      â”œâ”€â”€ mac
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
      â”œâ”€â”€ windows
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
  // truncated for brevity
  â”œâ”€â”€ testnet
    â”œâ”€â”€ 0.6.2
      â”œâ”€â”€ linux
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
      â”œâ”€â”€ mac
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
      â”œâ”€â”€ windows
        â”œâ”€â”€ tbnbcli
  // truncated for brevity
.README.md
```

Say you're on a Mac and want to interact with the Binance testnet. If so, you must invoke the client using something like this:

```
cli/testnet/0.6.2/mac/tbnbcli
```

Yeah, I bet you don't wanna type this every time you must execute a command. To make things easier, you would want to create an `alias` by entering the following command:

```bash
alias tbnbcli=cli/testnet/0.6.2/mac/tbnbcli
``` 

This way, every time you want to run the client, you'll just type `tbnbcli`.

Pretty sweet, isn't it?ðŸ¤“

## Put it to the test

1. Define an alias named `tbnbcli` that executes the **_Linux version_** of the `tbnbcli` command-line utility. If you can't remember the syntax, take a look at the example from above. The syntax is similar.
