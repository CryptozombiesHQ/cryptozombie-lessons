[Level  up! You’ve unlocked 3 new abilities: Burn, Freeze, Unfreeze]

Ah… You’ve made it more than half way! I see your mind is especially suited for this, it seems you’ve grasped 3 advanced techniques. I have your training ground setup so you can give them a try.

## Burn - “It’s better to burn out, than to fade away”

Burning is a way to irrevocably destroy tokens. If you burn a token, then it'll disappear and the amount is also subtracted from the total supply. On Ethereum, burning tokens often means  sending them to the `0x0` address, a kind of blackhole address. But because the tokens didn’t actually disappear, some block explorers, indexers and other tools might not display the correct data. Burning, freezing, and unfreezing are all native functions on the Binance chain and therefore, it’s significantly easier to do and with less unintended side effects.

Example:

```
tbnbcli token burn --amount 100000000000000000 --symbol TOAST --from testKey --chain-id=Binance-Chain-Nile --node=data-seed-pre-2-s1.binance.org:80 --trust-node
```

The burn command is probably what you expected: “token burn”. The process is straightforward and the only thing to be careful of is the amount which has to include 8 decimal parts.

## Put it to the test

Burn 10 `MAT-2A5` tokens using `testKey` in the CLI. Make sure to double check the amount and then type your password.
