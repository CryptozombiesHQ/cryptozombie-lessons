In this first lesson, we delve into the fundamental aspects of smart contract development to create NFTs with royaltyes. To set up the project, you'll use the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter" target="_blank">Optimism Starter</a> that does all the heavy lifting. The Optimism starter is formed of the following main components:

- **wagmi**: A VanillaJS library containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. It makes it easy to connect to a wallet, display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more.
- **Foundry**: A powerful and user-friendly Ethereum development framework that facilitates the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts. It is designed to streamline the development process and provide you with a convenient set of tools and utilities for building decentralized applications.
- **RainbowKit**: A React library that makes it easy to add a wallet connection to your decentralized application. It's intuitive, responsive, and customizable.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

Note that, even if the Optimism starter streamlines both smart contract and front-end development, this course will focus on teching you how to write smart contracts.

Provided that Node.js has already been installed on your computer, the first thing you must do is install Foundry and the Optimism starter.

# Putting it to the Test

1. To install Foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer, enter the `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` command in the terminal to the right.
2. Run the `foundryup` command to install Foundry.
3. Use the `git clone` command to clone the `https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter.git` Git repository. This creates a local copy of the remote repository's files in a new directory named `optimism-starter`.
4. Enter the `cd optimism-starter` command to change the current working directory to `optimism-starter`.
