In this new course, we will guide you on how to construct Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with royalty capabilities, and contracts seamlessly on OP Mainnet! To accomplish this, we will make use of the powerful tools at our disposal: the feature-rich <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter" target="_blank">Optimism Starter</a> toolkit, the convenient <a href="https://app.optimism.io/faucet" target="_blank">Superchain Faucet</a>, and the reliable and well-known OpenZeppelin's implementations of both ERC-721 and ERC-2981 standards.


## The Optimism Starter

The <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter" target="_blank">Optimism Starter</a> is an open-source project developed by the Optimism team that provides you with a well-structured template and pre-configured environment that streamlines the process of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Optimism network. It comes equipped with essential tools, libraries, and configurations, allowing you to focus on the logic of their smart contracts without having to worry about complex setup procedures.

## Superchain Faucet

The <a href="https://app.optimism.io/faucet" target="_blank">Superchain Faucet</a> is a web application that allows you to request ETH for the Optimism test network. It serves as a valuable resource for developers who want to experiment and test their applications without the need for real funds.

## The ERC-721 Standard

ERC-721 is a standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item.

## The ERC-2981 Standard

ERC-2981 represents a mechanism for creators to receive royalties whenever their NFTs are sold or traded on a marketplace, allowing contracts to signal a royalty amount to be paid to the NFT creator or rights holder every time the NFT is sold or re-sold. This is intended for NFT marketplaces that want to support the ongoing funding of artists and other NFT creators. Note that the royalty payment must be voluntary, as executing transfers between wallets does not always imply a sale occurred.

By the end of this course, you will possess the expertise to craft NFTs with royalties and leverage the scalability and cost advantages provided by OP Mainnet.
