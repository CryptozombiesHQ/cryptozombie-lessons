The Optimism Starter utilizes a well-organized directory structure to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts on OP Mainnet, as shown below:

```
├── FAQ.md
├── README.md
├── attestation-station.md
├── cache
│   └── solidity-files-cache.json
├── contracts
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── lib
│   ├── out
│   ├── script
│   ├── src
│   └── test
├── foundry.toml

│   └── wagmi.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── wagmi.config.ts
```

 Here's an explanation of the main directories and their purposes:

 - `contracts/src/`: This directory contains your smart contract source files, and it's the primary location where store your smart contracts.
- `contracts/test/`: This directory is reserved for your smart contract test files.
- `contracts/script/`: You can use this directory to place any additional Solidity scripts you need for your project. Solidity scripts are like the scripts you write when working with tools like Hardhat; what makes Solidity scripting different is that they are written in Solidity instead of JavaScript, and they are run on the fast Foundry EVM backend, which provides dry-run capabilities.
- `src/`: This directory contains the front-end code.
- `package.json`: This file is part of Node.js project and manages dependencies, scripts, and project metadata. It specifies the required packages and scripts used in your project.

Why should I use this directory structure, you ask?

Let's take a brief look at the advantages of using a standardized directory structure:
  - **Consistency**: Following a standardized directory structure ensures consistency across projects within an organization or community. When developers work on multiple projects or collaborate with others, having a consistent directory structure makes it easier to navigate and understand the codebase. It reduces the time spent on familiarizing oneself with the project structure and enables developers to focus more on the actual code and functionality.
  - **Maintainability**: A well-defined directory structure improves code maintainability. By organizing files and directories in a logical manner, it becomes easier to locate specific components, modules, or resources within the project. This saves time when developers need to make changes or troubleshoot issues. It also promotes modular design and separation of concerns, as related files are grouped together, making it easier to understand the project's architecture.
  - **Automation**: Many development tools and frameworks rely on specific directory structures to provide certain functionalities or automate tasks. By adhering to these conventions, you can take advantage of tooling that simplifies tasks such as build processes, testing, code analysis, and deployment. Following conventions ensures compatibility with these tools and allows for smoother integration into the development workflow.


Before you start writing the smart contract, you must install all the required dependencies. For this, you'll use the `npm install` command. This command is used in Node.js projects to install the dependencies defined in the project's `package.json` file.

# Putting it to the Test

1. In the terminal to the right, enter the `npm install` command.
