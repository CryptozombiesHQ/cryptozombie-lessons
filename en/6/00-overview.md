Huh, you've made it this far?!

You're no ordinary CryptoZombie...

By completing Lesson 5, you've demonstrated that you have a pretty firm grasp of Solidity.

But no DApp is complete without a way for its users to interact with it...

In this lesson, we're going to look at how to interact with your smart contract and build a basic front-end for your DApp using a library called **Web3.js**.

Note that app front-ends are written in **JavaScript**, not Solidity. But since the focus of this course is on Ethereum / Solidity, we're assuming you are already comfortable building websites with HTML, JavaScript (including ES6 <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises" target=_blank>promises</a>), and JQuery, and will not be spending time covering the basics of those languages.

If you are not already comfortable building websites with HTML / Javascript, you should complete a basic tutorial elsewhere before starting this lesson.
