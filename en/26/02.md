In this lesson, you'll learn how to import modules from the `@cityofzion/neon-core` and `commander` packages in your program. We went ahead and created a new JavaScript file for you. Take a look at the pane to the right. Also, to get everything ready for you, we've filled in some boilerplate code. Things to note about this code:

- To interact with the Neo blockchain, we'll use Remote Procedure Call (RPC), a communication protocol that allows a program running on one device or computer to invoke procedures or functions on another device or computer over a network. It enables distributed applications or systems to interact and exchange data transparently as if they were local. In other words, you can invoke a method of a smart contract deployed on Neo in a similar fashion as if it was implemented in your program. Pretty neat!ðŸ”¥

  However, to do so, the program needs the URL where the Neo NS API is hosted. To make it easier to run the program against the testnet or mainnet, we've made it so that the program reads the value of the URL from an environment variable:

  ```js
  const URL = process.env.URL
  if (typeof URL === 'undefined') {
    console.log('The URL environment variable is not defined.')
    process.exit(1)
  }
  ```

- The code that you'll write will read data from the blockchain and it'll also write by sending transactions. For this, it needs a private key. To prevent the private key from being pushed to GitHub, the application assumes that it's being stored in an environment variable named `PRIVATE_KEY`:

  ```js
  const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY
  if (typeof privateKey === 'undefined') {
    console.log('The PRIVATE_KEY environment variable is not defined.')
    process.exit(1)
  }
  ```

## Using Named Imports

In Node.js, a named import is a way to import specific entities (variables, functions, classes, or objects) from a module or file using their exact names.

Here's an example of a named import in Node.js:

```js
import { entity1, entity2 } from myModule;
```

In the code above, we used the `import` statement to import `entity1` and `entity2`  from `myModule`. Note that the names of the entities being imported are specified within curly braces. With named imports, you can selectively import only the entities you need from a module, rather than importing the entire module. This helps reduce memory consumption and improves code organization.

Named imports can also be combined in a single `import` statement:

```js
import { entity1, entity2, entity3 } from myModule;
```

In this example, `entity1`, `entity2`, and `entity3` are all imported from `myModule`.


## Putting it to the Test

1. In the pane to the right, the first line should use the `import` statement to import `tx`, `wallet`, `CONST`, `rpc`, `sc`, and `u` from `@cityofzion/neon-core`, combining them in a single `import` statement.

2. Similarly to the above, import `Command` from `commander`.
