Awesome, you've constructed a NeoVM script! In this lesson, we'll look into how you can construct a transaction.

The `neo-js` library provides a convenient way to construct a Neo transaction by using the `Transaction` class, allowing you to specify properties such as signers, validity, script, attributes, and other transaction-related data. Then, once a transaction is constructed, you can sign it, serialize it, and finally broadcast it to the network.

Before we look into how to construct a transaction, you must get yourself familiarized with three concepts that are fundamental in Neo - witnesses, witness scope and the expiration height of a transaction.

## Witnesses

A witness refers to the cryptographic signature associated with a transaction. It is a form of proof that demonstrates the authorization or approval of the transaction by the relevant accounts or entities involved.

When a transaction is created and signed, the witnesses are included to provide cryptographic evidence that the transaction has been authorized by the necessary parties. The witness includes information such as the public key, signature, and verification script.

The Neo blockchain verifies the authenticity and integrity of a transaction by validating the included witnesses. During the validation process, the network checks if the provided witness signatures match the corresponding public keys and if they satisfy the conditions defined in the transaction's verification script.

Witnesses play a crucial role in ensuring the security and trustworthiness of transactions on the Neo blockchain. They provide a mechanism to verify the identity and authorization of the involved parties, preventing unauthorized or tampered transactions from being executed.

Overall, witnesses in Neo are cryptographic signatures that serve as proof of authorization.

## Witness Scope

The witness scope refers to the level of authorization or permission required for a witness to sign a transaction. It determines the scope of the witness's influence on the transaction's validation and execution.

Neo supports different witness scopes, each indicating a different level of authorization. The available witness scopes are:
- `None`: This scope means that the witness does not provide any authorization for the transaction. Transactions with a witness scope of `None` do not require any signatures and can be executed by anyone.
- `CalledByEntry`: This scope indicates that the witness must be explicitly invoked by the contract's entry point. The witness provides authorization for the execution of the contract. This scope is typically used when the contract needs to validate the identity or permissions of the invoker.
- `CustomContracts`: This scope allows the witness to authorize the transaction only for specific contracts defined by the contract script itself. It restricts the execution of the transaction to the specified contracts.
- `CustomGroups`: This scope allows the witness to authorize the transaction only for specific groups of accounts defined by the contract script. It restricts the execution of the transaction to the specified groups of accounts.
By specifying the witness scope in a transaction, the transaction's validation and execution can be tailored based on the required level of authorization. Different scopes provide different levels of security and flexibility in controlling transaction execution.

Note that the witness scope is defined and enforced at the protocol level in Neo. The specific scope required for a transaction depends on the contract design and the desired authorization requirements.

Overall, the witness scope in Neo determines the level of authorization required for a witness to sign a transaction and influences the transaction's validation and execution.


## Expiration Height of a Transaction

Remember that the block height refers to the position of a block within the blockchain. Each new block added to the blockchain increments the block height by one. In Neo, you can specify the block height until which a transaction is considered valid. This ensures that the transaction remains valid for a specific duration.

Setting the expiration height of a transaction is needed for the following reasons:

- **Time Sensitivity**: Transactions in blockchain systems like Neo have a limited validity period to prevent replay attacks and ensure the execution of transactions in a timely manner. By specifying the expiration height, you ensure that the transaction is processed within a specific timeframe. If the transaction is not included in a block before the specified block height, it is considered expired and will not be executed.
- **Consensus Efficiency**: By setting an expiration height for a transaction, the network can prioritize and process transactions more efficiently. Transactions with shorter validity periods are prioritized over transactions with longer validity periods. This helps to maintain the overall performance and consensus efficiency of the Neo network.

Let's look at how this actually works.

When you broadcast a transaction to the network, you can set a propety named `validUntilBlock` that defines the maximum block height at which the transaction can be included in a block and executed. To determine an appropriate value for the `validUntilBlock` property, you typically consider the current block height at the time of creating the transaction and add a certain number of blocks to set an expiration height. The number of blocks added depends on the desired validity duration.

For example, if the current block height is 10,000 and you want the transaction to remain valid for 100 blocks, you would set `validUntilBlock` to 10,100. This means that the transaction must be included in a block with a height less than or equal to 10,100 for it to be considered valid.


To determine the current block height, you can use the following example code:

```js
const currentHeight = await rpcClient.getBlockCount()
```

## Putting Everything Together

Now let's put everything you've learned in this chapter together, and look at an example of you can build a transaction:

```js
const currentHeight = await rpcClient.getBlockCount()
const transaction = new tx.Transaction({
  signers: [
    {
      account: account.scriptHash,
      scopes: tx.WitnessScope.CalledByEntry
    }
  ],
  validUntilBlock: currentHeight + 1000,
  script
})
```

In this example, the current height is retrieved and stored in a variable named `currentHeight`.
Then, a new `Transaction` object is created using the `tx.Transaction` constructor. The constructor takes an object as an argument with the following properties:

- `signers`: : This property is an array containing one or more signers of the transaction. Each signer is represented as an object with two properties: `account` and `scopes`. The `account` property refers to the script hash of the account that will sign the transaction, while the `scopes` property specifies the witness scope for the signature. In this example, there is only one signer defined.

- `validUntilBlock`: This property specifies the block height until which the transaction is considered valid. In the Neo blockchain, blocks are generated approximately every 15 seconds. In this lesson, let's calculate it by adding a `1000` to the current block height. This ensures that the transaction remains valid for roughly four hours.

- `script`: This property represents the NeoVM script object that defines the operation to be performed by the transaction. It is the script you've already created using the `ScriptBuilder` class.

Enough talking, let's write some code!

## Putting it to the Test

1. Below the line that declares the `script` `const`, retrieve the current height by calling the `getBlockCount` method of the `rpcClient` object. Store the result in a `const` named `currentHeight`. Since this function it's async, make sure you're using `await` to invoke it.

2. Construct a transaction and store it in a `const` named `transaction`. All you have to do is to copy and paste the example above.
