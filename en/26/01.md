## Set Up a New JavaScript Project

Before you write any code or install any of the dependencies, the first thing you must do is set up a new JavaScript project. This step is important because it creates a new `package.json` file that serves as a blueprint for managing dependencies, scripts, and other project-related configurations. It contains essential metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. To initialize a new project, you must enter the following command:


```shell
yarn init
```

This command will start the initialization process and prompt you to provide information about your project. However, for simplicity, you'll initialize a new JavaScript project with a default `package.json` file, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about the initial project setup. To do so, you must add the `--yes` to the command above.


## Installing Dependencies

In this course, you will learn how to make a CLI that interacts with the Neo Name Service API. For this, you'll use the following libraries:

- The `@cityofzion/neon-js` library, also known as Neon, is an open-source JavaScript library specifically designed for interacting with the Neo blockchain. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that enable you to interact with smart contracts, send transactions, query blockchain data, and more. It abstracts away the complexities of interacting with the Neo blockchain directly, providing a more developer-friendly interface.
- The `commander` is a Node.js library that simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) in JavaScript. It provides a set of intuitive and powerful features for building robust and user-friendly command-line applications.


To install a new package, run the following command, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install:


```shell
yarn add <package-name>
```
Yarn will save the package as a dependency in the dependencies section of your `package.json` file.


## Putting it to the Test

1. In the terminal emulator to the right, enter the command for initializing a new JavaScript project with a default `packages.json` file.

2. Install the `@cityofzion/neon-js` library.

3. Install the `commander` library.

That's it! You have successfully initialized a new JavaScript project and installed the `neon-js` and `commander` libraries using Yarn. In the next lessons, you'l learn how to use these libraries by importing them or utilizing their functionalities in your code.
