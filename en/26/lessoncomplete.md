Congratulations, you've made it to the end of our Node.js CLI Mastery course for Neo Name Service! Give yourself a pat on the back and a well-deserved round of applause. You are now a certified CLI ninja, ready to conquer the blockchain world with your command-line superpowers!

But before we bid you farewell, let's take a moment to reflect on our incredible journey together. We've laughed, we've learned, and we've written more command-line commands than we can count. Who knew that a CLI-based client could be so much fun?!

We hope you've had as much fun as we did, and we look forward to seeing you continue your CLI adventures in the future. Until then, stay curious, keep coding, and remember: the command line is where the real magic happens!

Farewell, fellow CLI maestro. May your code always run smoothly, and may the Neo Name Service be forever in your command!
