In the tab to the right, we've initialized the `Command` class provided by the `commander` module. Then, we configured the `program` object using method chaining. After this configuration, we've continued fleshing out the CLI by adding a command named `get-roots`.

Before you move forward, check out the code and familiarize yourself with it.


The Neo Name Service (NeoNS) is a distributed open naming system based on Neo blockchain. The main goal of NeoNS is to map names like `cryptozombies.neo` to other source identifiers such as N3 addresses, NeoFS shared links, IPV4 addresses, IPV6 addresses, and other metadata. NeoNS also has dot-separated hierarchical names called domains. The owner of a domain has full control of all its subdomains.
Top-level domains, like `.neo`, are owned by the Neo Committee. Users can only register domains with the registered top-level domains, such as `cryptozombies.neo`. Once the domain `cryptozombies.neo` is registered, the owner can register any subdomains ended with it, for example, `courses.cryptozombies.neo`, and configure it with records.

That being said, the first thing you should do is retrieve the list of top-level domains.

As the node and the client are written in different programming languages, before sending an RPC request over the network, the data and parameters of the request need to be serialized (marshaled) into a format suitable for transmission. Similarly, upon receiving the response, the data needs to be deserialized (unmarshalled) to reconstruct the objects or values in the client's programming language (JavaScript).

Fortunatelly, you don't have to deal with this, because the `@cityofzion/neon-core` library takes care of almost everything! It provides an object named `Query` that acts as a simple wrapper around a request/response pair, allowing you to generate queries quickly. To use it, you must:

1. Create a new instance of the `rpc.Query` object. The constructor takes one parameter - an object containing the following key-value pairs:
- `method`: A string that must be set to `invokefunction`
- `params`: An array that contains the following:
    - The address of the smart contract that you want to invoke.
    - The name of the function you want to call
    - An array of objects containing any parameters you want to pass to the function. Each parameter is an object composed of two key-value pairs:
      - `type`: A string indicating the type of the parameter (example: `Integer`, `String`)
      - `value`: A string containing the actual value that you want to pass

2. Call the `rpcClient.execute` method, passing it the query object you've created in the previous step.

Enough talking, let's look at an example:

```js
const myQuery = new rpc.Query({
  method: 'invokefunction',
  params: [
    MY_CONTRACT,
    'makeSandwich',
    [
      { type: 'String', value: 'cheese' },
      { type:  'String', value: 'ham'}
    ]
  ]
})
const response = await rpcClient.execute(myQuery)
```

The example code above, invokes the `makeSandwich` function of `MY_CONTRACT`, passing it two parameters (`ham` and `cheese`) and storing the result in a variable named `response`.

As making requests to the Neo blockchain would require you to write repetitive code, let's make a generic function named `sendQuery` that you can reuse for all the queries in this course. This function takes three parameters:
- `rpcClient`.
- A string, representing the name of the method you want to invoke. For example, to retrieve to list of top-level domains, this must be set to `getRoots`.
- The arguments that the method expects.

## Putting it to the Test

1. Declare an `async` function named `sendQuery`. It takes three parameters:
  - `rpcClient`
  - `operation`
  - `args`

2. Inside of the `sendQuery` function, create a new instance of the `rpc.Query` object. Use the example code above, and keep in mind that the address of the Neo NS smart contract is stored in a variable named `NS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

3. Call the `rpcClient.execute` function, passing it the `query` variable as a parameter. Store the response in a `const` named `response`. Don't forget that this function reads data from the blockchain, which means it's asynchronous and you must use the `await` keyword when calling it.

4. The last line of the function should return the `response` variable.

5. Inside of the `get-roots` command, invoke the `sendQuery` function and store the result in a variable named `response`. As the `roots` method of the Neo NS smart contract doesn't take any parameters, the `args` array must be empty.
