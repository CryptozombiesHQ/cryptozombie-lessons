In the Forge Foundry framework, the `setUp` function is a special function you can define within your test contract to set up the initial state and conditions for your test cases. It is executed before each individual test function within the contract. In a nutshell, this function serves as a preparation step, allowing you to initialize variables, deploy contracts, or perform any other necessary actions required for your tests.


## Putting it to the Test

1. Inside of the `RoyaltiesTest` smart contract, declare a `public` function named `setUp`. The function doesn't take any parameters and doesn't return any values either.
