Awesome, you've successfully tested that the `supportsInterface` function works as expected and your smart contract supports both the ERC-721 and ERC-2981 standards!

Next, let's move on to testing whether minting new tokens works as expected. To make it more straightforward, we'll divide this into two separate tests:

- First, ensure that the recipient and the token URI are correct. Note that the recipient and the owner are the same in this scenario.
- Second, verify that the royalty is also set as expected.


So, the mintNFT function takes two parameters: `recipient` of type `address` and `tokenURI` of type `string`.

To test whether the recipient is set as expected, you can use a function called `makeAddr` provided by Forge. This function allows you to programmatically create addresses for testing purposes.

Below is an example of you can use the `makeAddr` function to create an addres:

```sol
address alice = makeAddr("alice");
```

## Putting it to the Test

1. Below the line of code that declares the `name` variable, create a new `private` variable named `alice` of type `address`. Use it to store the value returned by calling the `makeAddr` function with `alice` as a parameter.

2. Declare a `public` function named testMintNFT.

2. Inside the `testMintNFT` function, call the `mintNFT` method of the `royalties` smart contract, passing it `alice` and "tokenURI" as parameters. Store the result in a `uint256` named `tokenId`. Note that "tokenURI" is just a placeholder, and you should use a proper token URI for your NFTs.

3. Assert that the owner of `tokenId` is equal to `alice`. To retrieve the owner, use the `ownerOf` method of the `royalties` smart contract. It takes one parameter - `tokenId`.

4. Assert that the token URI of `tokenId` is equal to `tokenURI`. To retrieve the token URI, use the `tokenURI` method of the `royalties` smart contract. It takes one parameter - `tokenId`.
