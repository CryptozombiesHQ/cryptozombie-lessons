Congratulations on your successful deployment to Optimism Goerli! Now, can you guess what's coming up next? You got it right! In this chapter, we'll guide you through the process of deploying on OP Mainnet. Let's take the next step together!

At this stage, you need to configure Foundry to deploy on OP Mainnet by updating the `.env`` file. We skipped this step in the course to avoid unnecessary repetition, and we trust you to handle it confidently on your own. You've got this!


# Putting it to the Test

1. Enter the `npm run deploy` command to deploy your smart contract.
