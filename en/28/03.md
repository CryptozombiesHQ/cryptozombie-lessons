Now that you've declared the `setUp` function, let's take a look at what it should do - create an instance of the `Royalties` smart contract and store the address of its owner.

To create a new instance of the `Royalties` contract, you must use the `new` keyword. It invokes the constructor of your contract to initialize the newly created instance:

```sol
myContractInstance = new MyContract();
```

> Note: Since `RoyaltiesTest` will deploy `Royalties` it means that the owner address should be set to the instance of `RoyaltiesTest` which you can retrieve using `address(this)`.

## Putting it to the Test

1. Before you can instantiate the `Royalties` smart contract, you must import it. To do so, use the `import` keyword and keep in mind that you must specify the relative address of the file containing the contract - "../src/Royalties.sol"
1. Inside of the `RoyaltiesTest` smart contract, declare a `private` variable named `royalties` of type `Royalties`.
2. The next line should declare a `private` variable named `owner` of type `address`. Since `RoyaltiesTest` will deploy `Royalties` it means that the owner address should be set to the instance of `RoyaltiesTest` which you can retrieve using `address(this)`
3. Inside the `setUp` function, invoke `address(this)` and store the value it returns in the `owner` variable.
4. Use the `new` keyword to create a new instance of the `Royalties` smart contract and store it in the `royalties` variable. Remember that the constructor takes the following parameters: `name`, `symbol`, `defaultFeeNumerator`. We already declared them as private variables inside the `RoyaltiesTest` contract, so you should just ensure you pass them as parameters when invoking the constructor.
