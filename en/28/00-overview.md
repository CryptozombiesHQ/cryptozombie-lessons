Welcome to our lesson on testing and deploying smart contracts using the  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter" target="_blank">Optimism Starter</a>! Testing is a critical step in the smart contract development lifecycle and, under the hood, the Optimism starter uses Forge for this.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to leverage Forge, a robust testing framework that ships with Foundry and allows you to write comprehensive tests that cover various scenarios. We'll walk you through the process of executing tests, verifying the expected behavior, and identifying any potential issues or bugs.

Once your contract passes the testing phase, it's time to deploy it on OP Mainnet using Foundry. Foundry provides a streamlined deployment process, making deploying your smart contract on OP Mainnet effortless. You'll discover the step-by-step procedures to configure your deployment settings and unleash the scalability and cost-efficiency benefits that Optimism offers.
