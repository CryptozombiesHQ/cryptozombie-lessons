The first thing you want to do is test the constructor. To refresh your memory, we've copied and pasted its code below:

```sol
constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint96 _feeNumerator) ERC721(_name, _symbol) {
  _setDefaultRoyalty(msg.sender, _feeNumerator);
}
```

What this code does is that it calls the constructor of the ERC721 smart contract to explicitly set the name and the symbol and then calls the `_setDefaultRoyalty` function to specify the default royalty. Also, under the hood, the constructor sets the `owner` to the address where the `RoyaltiesTest` smart contract was deployed.

In this chapter, you will check that the owner, name, and symbol are set as expected. We’ll test if the default royalty is properly set later.

For this, you’ll use the `assertEq` function, a built-in assertion function that is used for equality comparisons during smart contract testing. It checks if the provided values are equal and, if not, triggers a test failure.

In the example below, the `testMyFunction` test case verifies the equality between the actual value returned from the `myFunction` function and the expected value of 42 using the `assertEq` function. If the values are not equal, the test will fail, and an error message will be displayed, indicating the mismatch between the actual and expected values:

```sol
function testMyFunction() public {
  uint256 expected = 42;
  uint256 actual = myContract.myFunction();
  assertEq(actual, expected, "Value mismatch: actual and expected do not match");
}
```

Note that, to retrieve the name and the symbol, the ERC-721 smart contract provides two functions: `name` and `symbol`.

We went ahead and declared the variables that store the default fee numerator, name, and symbol. Then, we created a `public` function named `testInitialState`.

Ready to enchant your screens with code? Don't hold back, it's time to let the magic flow through your fingertips.

## Putting it to the Test

1. The first line of the `testInitialState` function should ensure that the value returned by the `royalties.name` function equals `name`. If not, it should display the following message - "The name should be Royalties".
1. Next, it should ensure that the value returned by the `royalties.symbol` function equals `symbol`. If not, it should display the following message - "The symbol should be ROYAL".
