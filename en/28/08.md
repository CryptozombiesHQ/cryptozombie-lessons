The tests in the previous chapters were designed to provide you with an idea of how you can test your smart contracts. However, they are by no means an exhaustive set of tests. Now that you have acquired this knowledge, we trust you to write all the necessary tests to ensure that your smart contract functions flawlessly.

With that said, it's time to explore how you can deploy your smart contracts to Optimism. Here's how it works: first, you'll deploy your smart contract to Optimism Goerli, a public testnet where you can conduct further testing. Once you feel confident and ready, you can deploy your contract on OP Mainnet.

Before you start, make sure you have the following information ready:

- Your private key
- Your Optimism Goerli Etherscan API key. If you don't have one, you can obtain it by visiting <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/register" target=_blank>Register</a> page of the Optimism Explorer and following the instructions.
- Your Alchemy API key. If you don't have one, you can get it by visiting the <a href="https://auth.alchemy.com/signup" target=_blank>Alchemy Sign Up</a> page and following the instructions.
- Additionally, to deploy your contract, you'll need some ETH to cover the gas fees. You can get ETH on the Optimism Goerli using the convenient <a href="https://app.optimism.io/faucet" target="_blank">Superchain Faucet</a>.

## Understanding .env Files

An `.env` file is a configuration file commonly used in software development to store environment variables. Environment variables are values that can be accessed by software applications during runtime. These variables typically include sensitive information, such as API keys, private keys, or other configuration settings, that the application needs to function properly.

The name ".env" stands for "environment," and the file itself is often a plain text file without any specific file extension. In the file, each environment variable is defined on a separate line in the format `KEY=VALUE`.

The Optimism Starter comes with an example file named `.env.example`. Let's start editing it to match your environment.

> **NOTE**: In this chapter, you will use dummy values. Please, always remember never to expose your private keys, passwords, or API keys, and avoid submitting them to GitHub. Revealing your private key could result in the complete loss of your assets.


## Putting it to the Test

1. In the tab to the right, specify the following values:

  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=3B8X4SX7PPDHR5DTSIFWDR5I86D6XDWPKE`
  - `FORGE_RPC_URL=https://opt-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/5ZHeE8iDOKQZGlihgvdflYxL-axQttjl`
  - `FORGE_PRIVATE_KEY=0xbe0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7cf4f2fa80`
