Remember that your smart contract inherits from both ERC-721 and ERC-2981. In the previous lesson, we had to override the `supportsInterface` function. The way it should work is that the `supportsInterface` function should return `true` when queried if it supports ERC-721 and ERC-2981.

To refresh your memory, the prototype of the `supportsInterface` function is as follows:

```sol
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
```

The function takes a single argument named `interfaceId`, which is a unique identifier for the interface being queried. The interface identifier is the `XOR` of all function selectors in the interface.

The ID of the ERC-721 interface is `0x80ac58cd` and of the ERC-2981 interface is `0x2a55205a`. Feel free to calculate them yourself if you don’t trust us:)

That being said, for both interfaces, you’ll have to use the `assertEq` function to ensure that the `supportsInterface` returns `true`.


## Putting it to the Test

1. Make a new `public` function named `testSupportsERC721Interface`. It should ensure that calling `royalties.supportsInterface` with `0x80ac58cd` as a parameter returns `true`.

2. Make a new `public` function named `testSupportsERC2981Interface`. It should ensure that calling `royalties.supportsInterface` with `0x2a55205a` as a parameter returns `true`.
