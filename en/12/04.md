In this chapter you’re going to learn how to fund your Shop Owner address. 

The Libra coin on the testnet has no real value. You can make mistakes and it doesn’t matter. On the mainnet, Libra is created by the validators, but on the testnet we can create some Libra to play with through a process called minting:

```
>libra% account mint 3 300 
```

In this example, you’re minting 300 LBR to the account with index 3. 

Remember that in Chapter 1 we said an account doesn’t exist on the Libra blockchain until it has LBR? 

Minting LBR to an account will add that account to the blockchain.

# Put it to the test

Mint 300 LBR to the Shop Owner account. 

(Hint: the index for the shop owner account is 0)

Then 300 LBR to the Hero's account.

## Did you know...?

>>>
The Libra coin market cap is currently a 64 bit unsigned integer, so if you mint too many coins without any checks you can exceed the maximum limit! This will not be a problem in the production Libra system because coins will be backed with real-world currencies, and thus minting will be correspondingly rarer but far more costlier!
