                Welcome to Libra!

                This script will download and install the necessary dependencies needed to
                build Libra Core. This includes:
                        * Rust (and the necessary components, e.g. rust-fmt, clippy)
                        * CMake, protobuf

                If you'd prefer to install these dependencies yourself, please exit this script
                now with Ctrl-C.

                Proceed with installing necessary dependencies? (y/N) > y
                Installing Rust......
                info: downloading installer
                info: updating existing rustup installation


                Rust is installed now. Great!

Now that we've walked you through the basics, it's time to set this up on your own computer and try it for real. 

The first is to make sure you're on a mac, linux, or a windows computer with WSL. [(Here's a guide if you haven't done this before.)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). 

# Installing the CLI

First we need to download the code to the CLI. First open the Terminal:
- On a Mac: You can find the Terminal app in the Applications folder
- On linux: Ctrl + Alt + T will launch the Terminal
- On WSL: Launch the Ubuntu app

Navigate to a folder where you want Libra to go and download the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/libra/libra.git
```

>>>
Notice each line starts with `$` which indicates your in the shell prompt.

Then we make sure we're on the testnet by running:

```
cd libra
git checkout testnet
```

Once done, installing the dependencies is just one command away:

```
./scripts/dev_setup.sh
```

Press `y` when asked to confirm, and you're done!


# Put it to the Test

Do a practice run here and install the CLI tool.
