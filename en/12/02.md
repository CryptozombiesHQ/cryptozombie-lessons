Since banks don’t exist yet in the Crypto Zombie world, you’ll also need to create accounts for all your customers, the Heroes who want to buy equipment.  


You can use the same command as in Chapter 1 to create a new account: 

```
>libra% account create
```

The output should now be familar to you:

```
> Creating/retrieving next account from wallet
Created/retrieved account #1 address 771bf474bb2db506e187f0756b464a3e28896efa2516867ea001187d7c174066
```

You can see that the *index* for the new account is 1. 

Every time you create a new account, the index will increase by 1. 

# Put it to the test

Create 5 new accounts. 

When you're finished, click "check answer" below.

## Did you know...?

>>>
Accounts on a blockchain is really based on a public/private key pair. You can read up about this in detail on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). The whole process is done completely on your computer without submitting any data to internet. Once the keypair is created, you can derive an infinite number of accounts from it. This keypair is also called a "wallet", since it "holds" all the accounts derived from it. So it's really essential to make sure your private key never hits the internet, otherwise all your money may be at risk. For people familiar with other blockchains, Libra also have an "account creation fee", whereby the account only becomes active once the fee is paid.
