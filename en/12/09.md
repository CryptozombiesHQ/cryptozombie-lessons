Once the install process is finished, and don't worry if it takes a while, there's a lot to install. You can connect to the CLI with this command:

```
./scripts/cli/start_cli_testnet.sh
```

It should do even more installs like this:
```
Building and running client in debug mode.
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/calibra/curve25519-dalek.git`
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/calibra/ed25519-dalek.git`
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/calibra/x25519-dalek.git`
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/calibra/rust-curve25519-fiat.git`
  Downloaded reqwest v0.9.19
  Downloaded serde v1.0.99
  Downloaded typed-arena v1.5.0
  ....
```

Once it's finished building, you're finally ready! You should be greeted with this:

```

All the commands should be pretty familar to you now, if you want, click the little hamburger button on the bottom left screen and go back to chapter 1,you can redo all the commands on the real testnet for a review. I'll wait for you here while you do that. 

All done? There's just one more thing to cover. Notice when you start the tool, it says `Connected to validator at: ac.testnet.libra.org:8000`.

Validators are the organizations that run the actual servers that check each transaction to make sure they're valid (using your public key as explained in Chapter 4) and then enter them into the blockchain.

Blockchains have multiple validators who keep each other honest through a consensus mechanism, which typically includes financial penalties for cheating. In Libra, there will be 100 validators. Because of this large amount of validators, there is some amount of time required to achieve consensus with a target of 10 second finality time. You can get faster performance by offloading some transactions to a layer 2 solution for really advanced usage, but that's a lesson for another day. 

# Put it to the Test

Start the CLI! And then redo the commands from chapter 1 until 7.
