Once the transaction has had time to process, we can check on it's status:

```
>libra% query txn_acc_seq 1 0 true
```

This will spit out a bunch of technical details on the transaction on including it's status:

This is like a receipt in Libra-world that proves you've paid and transferred the money.

# Checking the Balance

Ok, now that the Hero has paid you, letâ€™s make sure you got the correct amount of LBR before you hand over the Shield.

To check balances, here's an example command:

```
$ query balance 2
```

This command is checking the balance of the account with index 2. 

# Put it to the Test

Check that the Shopkeeper balance is 350. (hint, remember which index he is?)

When you're finished, click "check answer" below. If you get stuck, you can click "hint".

## Did you know...?

>>>
You can query the balance of anyone, as long as you know their account address, since all the data is available on the blockchain. This is different and counter-intutive for someone who only used traditional banks before, no balance is secret. 

When you query a transaction, the unit shown is actually microlibra which is defined as `1/1000000` of a whole Libra. The smallest unit for regular currencies is usually called a *Pip* which is `1/10000` or 100 times larger than a microlibra.
