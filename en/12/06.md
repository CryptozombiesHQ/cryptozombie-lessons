Awesome work so far! Now we know for sure our users can create new zombies👌🏻.

However, if they could keep calling this function to create unlimited zombies in their army, the game wouldn't be very fun. Thus, in <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/2/chapter/4" target=_blank>Chapter 4 of Lesson 2</a> we've added a `require` statement to the `createZombieFunction()` that makes sure each user can't own more than one zombie:

```sol
require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0)
```

Let's test this feature and see if it works.

## Hooks

In just a few minutes🤞, we'll have more than one test and the way this works is that each test should start with a clean sheet. Thus, for every single test we'll have to create a new instance of our smart contract like so:

```javascript
const contractInstance = await CryptoZombies.new();
```

Wouldn't be nice if you could write this just once and have _Truffle_ run it automatically for every test?

Well... one of _Mocha_'s (and _Truffle_'s) features is the ability to have some snippets of code called _hooks_ run before or after a test. To run something before a test gets executed, the code should be put inside a function named `beforeEach()`.

So, instead of writing `contract.new()` several times, you just do it once like this:

```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
  // let's put here the code that creates a new contract instance
});
```

Then, `Truffle` will take care of everything. That's pretty sweet, isn't it?

# Put it to the test

1. Below the line of code that initializes `alice` and `bob`, let's declare a variable named `contractInstance`. Don't assign it to anything.

    >Note: We want `contractInstance` to be limited in scope to the block in which it's defined. Use `let` instead of `var`.

2. Next, copy/paste the snippet from above for defining the `beforeEach()` function.

3. Let's fill in the body of our new function. Go ahead and **move** the line of code that creates a new contract instance inside of the `beforeEach()` function. Now that we've defined `contractInstance` somewhere else, you can remove the `const` qualifier.

5. We're going to want a new empty `it` function for our test. Set the name of the test (that is the first parameter we're passing to the `it` function) equal to "should not allow two zombies".

We'll continue fleshing out this function in the next chapter!

### 🧟‍♂️Here be... zombies of every kind!!!🧟‍♂️

If you really, really want to **_achieve mastery_**, go ahead and read on. Otherwise... just click next and off you go to the next chapter.

You still around?😁

Awesome! After all, why would you want to deny yourself a whole lot of awesomeness?

Now, let's circle back to how `contract.new` works. Basically, every time we call this function, _Truffle_ makes it so that a new contract gets deployed.

On one side, this is helpful because it lets us start each test with a clean sheet.

On the other side, if everybody would create countless contracts the blockchain will become bloated. We want you to hang around, but not your old test contracts!

We would want to prevent this from happening, right?

Happily, the solution is pretty straightforward... our contract should `selfdestruct` once it's no longer needed.

The way this works is as follows:

- **first**, we would want to add a new function to the `CryptoZombies` smart contract like so:

 ```sol
 function kill() public onlyOwner {
     selfdestruct(owner());
 }
 ```
 >Note: If you want to learn more about `selfdestruct()`, you can read the _Solidity_ docs  <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#self-destruct" target=_blank>here</a>. The most important thing to bear in mind is that `selfdestruct` is the _only_ way for code at a certain address to be removed from the blockchain. This makes it a pretty important feature!

- **next**, somewhat similar to the `beforeEach()` function explained above, we'll make a function called `afterEach()`:

 ```javascript
 afterEach(async () => {
     await contractInstance.kill();
 });
 ```

- **Lastly**, _Truffle_ will make sure this function is called after a test gets executed.

And voila, the smart contract removed itself!

We have a lot of ground to cover in this lesson, and implementing this feature will likely require at least 2 additional chapters. So, we trust you to add it.💪🏻
