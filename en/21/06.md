## Functions in Rust

A function declaration in Rust looks like the following:

```rust
pub fn eat_hamburgers(&self, amount: u32) {

}
```

This is a function named `eat_hamburgers` that takes 2 parameters: a reference to `self` and a `u32`. For now the body of the function is empty. Note that we're specifying the function visibility as `public`. Without the `pub` keyword the function would be private, visible only within the module that implements it and its descendants. 

A module can be viewed as a modular trait that can be attached to the main contract trait providing extra functionality, but we will talk about it in a further lesson.

What is a reference type you ask?
 
Well, there are three ways in which you can pass an argument to a Rust function:

 * By value, which means that the ownership over the parameter's value is passed to your function. This blocks the use of the initial parameter once the function call has ended since having it consumed by the function.
 * By reference, which means that your function is borrowing the value of the parameter. Thus, this doesn't allow the function to change the value of the parameter since it is just `borrowed`. Once the function call finished, the ownership of the parameter returns to its initial owner.
 * By mutable reference, which means that your function is borrowing the value of the parameter and gets the permission to change it. Once the function call finished, the ownership of the parameter returns to its initial owner keeping all changes done inside the function.

> Note: Ownership in Rust is unique compared to other programming languages. The Rust compiler simply will not accept code that might lead to one of the memory management issues to which C++ instead exposes.

Rust's ownership model consists of 3 rules:
  * Each value in Rust has an owner.
  * There can only be one owner at a time.
  * When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

You would call this function like so from within trait / struct that implements it:

```rust
self.eat_hamburgers(100);
```

Like this from outside the trait that implements it:

```rust
Person::eat_hamburgers(100);
```

Or like this from outside the struct that implements it:

```rust
person.eat_hamburgers(100);
```

## Creating a structure instance

In Rust this is done by:

```rust
let given_name = ManagedBuffer::from(b"Bob");
let given_age = 30u32;
let person = Person { name: given_name, age: given_age };
```

If you have a variable whose name matches the structure field's, then the syntax can be simplified as shown below:


```rust
let name = ManagedBuffer::from(b"Bob");
let age = 30u32;
let person = Person { name, age };
```
## Using an indexed mapper

Adding an element to an indexed mapper is done just like adding an element to the normal one, the only difference being that you must specify the index, as shown in the following example:


```rust
self.persons(id).set(new_person);

```
## Reading the value of a mapper

To read the value of a `singleValueMapper`, use  the `get` method:


```rust
let my_person = self.persons(id).get();

```
## Updating a mapper value

For updating the value of a mapper,  you can use the `update` method which expects a closure as a parameter. You can see the closure as a nameless function that you use to access or process the elements.

```rust
let name = ManagedBuffer::from(b"Joe");
let age = 35u32;
let new_person = Person { name, age };

self.persons(id).update(|stored_person| *stored_person = new_person );
```
In the example code above, the `update` function contains a closure. The aim of this approach is to providea change to the `Person` instance from inside the storage. A closure is a functionthat captures the enclosing environment. Between the vertical slashes (|), we note the access the storage content under the name `stored_person`.

> Note: The `stored_person` variable is a reference to a `Person` instance (`&Person`). To access its value, you must dereference it using `*`.

Note that you can make a more complex closure in which you can make more operations. An example of it would be:

```rust
let new_number = 42u32;
let mut old_favorite_number = 0u32;

self.favorite_number(id).update(|number| { 
  old_favorite_number = *number;
  *number = new_number;
});
```

# Put it to the test

In our app, we need to be able to create new zombies. Let's create a function for that.
We also require `zombie_count` to increase its value every time a new zombie is added. 
1. Create a function named `create_zombie`. It should take two parameters: **\_name** (a `ManagedBuffer`), and **\_dna** (a `u64`).

2. Inside the body on the first line should update `zombies_count`. We will access it's content under the name `id`. Here `id` doesn't need to be dereferenced, since `zombies` requires a `&usize` in order to access a zombie.
  
3. Inside the update closure we create new zombie and put it inside `self.zombies(id)`.

4. Finally, don't forget to increment the value of `id`. Here `id` needs to be dereferenced since we work with its value.
