That's it, you've completed lesson 2!

You can check out the demo to the right to see it in action. Go ahead, I know you can't wait until the bottom of this page ðŸ˜‰. Click a kitty to attack, and see the new kitty zombie you get!

# Give it a try!

Select the kitty you want to feed on. Your zombie's DNA and the kitty's DNA will combine, and you'll get a new zombie in your army!

See those cute cat legs on your new zombie? That's our final `99` digits of DNA at work ðŸ˜‰

You can start over and try again if you want. When you get a kitty zombie you're happy with (you only get to keep one), go ahead and proceed to the next chapter to complete lesson 2!
