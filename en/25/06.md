In the fast-paced world of blockchain development, the ability to update smart contracts is essential. Luckily, as we've mentioned in the previous chapter, Neo provides a robust mechanism for updating already deployed contracts. This chapter aims to guide you through the process of updating a smart contract in Neo, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to effectively manage contract upgrades.

But why would you want to update an already deployed smart contract?ðŸ¤”

Here are some common scenarios where updating a smart contract is useful:

- **Bug Fixes and Security Enhancements**: Updates allow you to fix any bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in the deployed contract. By addressing security issues promptly, you can maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the contract.
- **Adding New Features**: As your project evolves, you may want to introduce new functionalities or enhance existing ones. Updating the contract enables you to incorporate additional features, improving the overall capabilities and user experience.
- **Optimizing Contract Performance**: Over time, you may identify areas for performance improvement within your contract. Updating allows you to optimize the contract logic, data structures, or algorithms.

Neo comes with a built-in class named `ContractManagement` that provides functionality for managing contracts, including methods to deploy, update, and manage smart contracts programmatically. This method takes the following parameters:
- `nefFile`: Represents the updated NEF (Neo Executable Format) file of the smart contract. The NEF file contains the compiled bytecode of the updated contract.
- `manifest`: Represents the updated manifest file of the smart contract. The manifest file contains metadata about the contract, such as its name, version, author, and supported methods.
- `data`: It is an optional parameter that can be used to pass additional data during the contract update.

That being said, it's important to ensure that the `Update` method of the `ContractManagement` class can only be called by the contract owner or an account with sufficient permissions. To do so you'll need to wrap it into your own function and add the necessary logic.

To help you out, we've added a function named `isOwner` that returns `true` if it has been called by the contract owner and `false` otherwise. This function uses `Runtime.CheckWitness`, a method in the Neo Smart Contract Framework that allows you to verify the authorization of the caller. In a nutshell, it checks whether the specified script hash is the same as the script hash of the caller.


The first thing the `Update` function must do is to check whether the caller is the contract owner. If the caller is not the contract owner it should `throw` an `InvalidOperationException`. If the caller is the contract owner it should perform the update logic, as shown below:

```cs
if (!IsOwner()) throw new InvalidOperationException("No Authorization!!");
// Update logic
```
## Putting it to the Test

1. Create a new `public static bool` function named `Update`. It takes two arguments - `nefFile` and `manifest`. Both parameters are of type `ByteString`.
2. The first line of your function should check if has been called by the contract owner. Jusg copy and paste the example code above.
3. The second line should invoke the `ContractManagement.Update` file and pass it three arguments: `nefFile`, `manifest`, and `null`
3. Lastly, your function must return `true`.
