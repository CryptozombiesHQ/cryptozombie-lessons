In this chapter, you're going to learn about the two types of operations a user can perform on zkSync:

* **Priority operations**. These are actions users initiate on the Ethereum network. Can you think of an example? Yup, deposits are priority operations.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

* **Transactions**. These are actions users initiate on zkSync. An example of a transaction is when Alice makes a payment on zkSync.

  Note the following about zkSync transactions:

  * When you submit a transaction to zkSync, it's **_instantly confirmed_** by the protocol. That's nice, but you should know that an instant confirmation is just a **_promise_** the operators make that they'll add the transaction to the next block. If you trust the operators then you don't need to wait for the transaction to be finalized.

  * A zkSync transaction is **final**  after the SNARK proof is accepted by the Ethereum smart contract. This takes around 10 minutes.

In this chapter, we'll look into how you can deposit assets to zkSync.

## Deposit assets to zkSync

Depositing assets to zkSync is as simple as calling the `depositToSyncFromEthereum` as follows:

```JavaScript
const deposit = await zkSyncWallet.depositToSyncFromEthereum({
    depositTo: recipient,
    token: token,
    amount: amountInWei
  })
```

The parameters of this function are self-explanatory, so we won't spend time explaining them.

But what happens **after** you call this function?

**_First_**, the transaction gets **mined** on the Ethereum network. At this stage, the transaction is not yet reflected on zkSync. However, if you don't want your users to stare at a blank screen for too long and you trust this is secure enough, you can use the `awaitEthereumTxCommit` function to `await` for the deposit transaction to be mined:

```JavaScript
await deposit.awaitEthereumTxCommit()
```

**_Second_**, the transaction is **committed** to zkSync. When this happens, your **balance gets updated** accordingly. To check when that happens, you can use the `awaitReceipt` function.

```JavaScript
await deposit.awaitReceipt()
```

**_Lastly_**, once a specific number of blocks get confirmed on Ethereum, the transaction is considered **finalized** or verified. You can check this by calling the `awaitVerifyReceipt` function.

```JavaScript
await deposit.awaitVerifyReceipt()
```
> Note: You can only verify a single condition, not all. In this lesson, we'll use the `deposit.awaitReceipt` function. For our purposes, it's a good enough bargain between security and user experience.

## Put it to the test

1. Create an `async` function called `depositToZkSync`. It expects the following parameters: `zkSyncWallet`, `token`, `amountToDeposit`, and `ethers`.

2. The first line of this function should call the `depositToSyncFromEthereum` function. Copy and paste the deposit example code at the start of this chapter, adjusting the following:
  * The `depositTo` should be set to the recipient's address. You can retrieve it by calling the `zkSyncWallet.address` function.
  * The protocol expects you to provide the `amountToDeposit` in `wei`. That's inconvenient because `wei` is the smallest sub-unit of Ether — there are 10^18 `wei` in one `ether`. To deposit 0.5 ETH, you'd have to declare the `amountToDeposit` variable as follows:

  ```JavaScript
  const amountToDeposit = '500000000000000000'
  ```

  Luckily `ethers` provides a function named `parseEther` that does all the heavy lifting for you. The following example converts `0.5` ETH to `wei`, and prints the result to the console:

  ```JavaScript
  const amountToDeposit = '0.5'
  const amountToDepositInWei = ethers.utils.parseEther(amountToDeposit)
  console.log(amountToDepositInWei)
  ```
  Let's replace `amountInWei` with `ethers.utils.parseEther(amountToDeposit)`.

3. Now, you would want to call the `deposit.awaitReceipt()` function to check whether your transaction is committed to zkSync. But just in case things go south with your deposit, let's wrap the line of code that calls this function inside of a `try/catch` statement. In JavaScript, a `try/catch` statement looks something like this:
  ```JavaScript
  try {
      doSomething()
    } catch (error) {
      doSomethingElse()
    }
  ```

4. Inside of the `try` block, just call the `deposit.awaitReceipt()` function and `await` for the promise to resolve.

5. Inside of the `catch` block, paste the following:

  ```JavaScript
  console.log('Error while awaiting confirmation from the zkSync operators.')
  console.log(error)
  ```
