Well done!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

You mastered the art of deploying smart contracts using _Truffle_!

Remember, building on top of **Loom** brings you faster, gas-free transactions that make it the perfect choice for creating blockchain games and user-facing DApps. At the same time, your users will enjoy the guaranteed security that Ethereum provides!

Another thing to remember is how similar deploying to **Loom** is to deploying to the Ethereum mainnet. You now know how to do both, just be careful how you choose which one to use for your next project😉.

Anyway, this was just an example — we made several decisions that simplified things a bit to make the lesson easier to understand.

To further your knowledge, head over to our <a href="https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-js" target=_blank>loom-js GitHub repository</a>. To add it to your project, just follow the instructions.

Happy coding!
