You're a legend!

You've now implemented **three** custom game modes with custom deck rules.

See how easy that can be?

Now only your imagination is the limit... 

In the very near future, you'll be able to use our Zombie Battleground Custom Game Creator tool to deploy your own smart contracts directly to Loom GameChain — and every Zombie Battleground player will be able to load your game mode and start playing it!

You can get a headstart now by starting to brainstorm your own custom game modes and writing out the Solidity contracts.

And we'll let you know as soon as the game creator tool goes live.
