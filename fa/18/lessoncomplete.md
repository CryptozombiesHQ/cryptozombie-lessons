Well done! You've now implemented an application that can deposit, transfer, and withdraw multiple assets. If you want to make payments using ETH again, you just need to set the value of the `token` variable back to `ETH`, and then update the `amountToDeposit`, `amountToTransfer`, and `amountToWithdraw` variables accordingly.

You could also use <a href="https://github.com/tj/commander.js/" target=_blank>Commander.js</a> or a similar library to allow your users to pass the token, the operation they want to perform, and the amount as command-line arguments, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The lessons in this series were aimed at getting you familiarized with the zkSync protocol. Even if this was just a demo implementation, and we've made a few decisions that simplified things a bit, we trust you have the skills to make a production-ready application!üí™üèª
