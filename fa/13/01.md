To issue a BEP-2 token, developers must pay a fee of 500 BNB tokens.

So before we can actually issue our BEP-2 token, he have to make sure there are enough tokens in our account. The way to get BNB tokens is through the Binance TestNet Faucet. All you have to do is to point your browser to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/dex/testnet/address" target=”_blank”> this page </a>, type the address of your wallet, and wait a few minutes for Binance to send the funds to your address.

It sounds straightforward, but there's a catch. The faucet credits each wallet with 200 TestNet BNB tokens. This means that we must create at least three wallets to get enough BNB tokens for our purposes.

That said, before moving forward with this lesson, you must get at least 500 TestNet BNB tokens by following these steps:

* If you don't have a Binance account, follow the instructions on the 
<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register" target=”_blank”> Binance Register page </a> to create one.

* Next, go to <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/create" target=”_blank”> this page </a> and create three Binance TestNet wallets. Let's call them A, B, and C. Download the keystore files and give them some meaningful names such as keystore_a, keystore_b, and keystore_c. Also, don't forget to save the mnemonics somewhere safe. We'll need them in the next chapter.

* Head over to the <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/unlock" target=”_blank”> Unlock page </a> and unlock wallet A. This will take you the Binance DEX main page. Select your account from the top menu bar and copy your address. Next, paste it to a new document.

* Repeat the step from above for wallet B and then for C.

* At this point, you are ready to get yourself some BNB TestNet tokens. Go to the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/dex/testnet/address" target=”_blank”> Binance TestNet Faucet</a> and paste your addresses.

<img src="/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-binance-faucet.png" alt="Binance Faucet" height="253" width="469">

* Once finished, click the Submit button. This will credit each wallet with 200 TestNet BNB tokens.

* Now, what's left to do is to transfer the BNB TestNet tokens from wallet B and C to wallet A. Let's unlock wallet B. Head over to the <a href="https://testnet.binance.org/en/unlock" target=”_blank”> Unlock page </a>. Next, upload the keystore file and then type the password. This will redirect you to the Binance TestNet home page. From the top menu bar select Balances and then click Send.

<img src="/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-send-bnb.png" alt="Send BNB" height="253" width="469">

* Fill in the input box with the address of the wallet A and make sure you send all the tokens by clicking the Max button.

<img src="/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-send-asset.png" alt="Send Asset" height="253" width="469">

* Now, confirm the transaction details and the tokens will be transferred to wallet A.

<img src="/static/image/lesson-13/bep2-loom-confirm-transaction.png" alt="Confirm Transaction" height="253" width="469">

* Repeat the process for wallet C.

Hooray! At this point, wallet A should hold 600 BNB tokens.


## Interacting with Binance chain

One of the ways in which you can interact with the Binance chain is through their command-line utility that lets users manage your keys, send transactions, issue, and transfer tokens, and so on so forth.

To grab the Binance Chain CLI, we'll need to clone a GitHub repository by entering something like the following:

```bash
git clone <repository-address>
```

# Put it to the test

Fire up a new terminal, then `cd` into your projects directory.

1. Clone the `https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary.git` repository.


Ugh... cloning the `node-binary` repository failed.

Let's find out why by taking a closer look at the output.

See this line?

```bash
git-lfs filter-process: git-lfs: command not found`
```

Git Large File Storage or `git-lfs` is a Git extension meant to help with versioning large files. The issue is that `git-lfs` is not installed on our system. We've gone ahead and installed it by following <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/)" target=”_blank”> these steps</a>. Then, we ran `cd node-binary/` directory.

2. Retry the checkout by running `git checkout -f HEAD`.
