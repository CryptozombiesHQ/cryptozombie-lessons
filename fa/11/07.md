In this chapter, we're going to fill in the body of our second test. Here's what it should do:
- First, Alice should call `createRandomZombie` and give it `zombieNames[0]` as the name of her first zombie.
- Next, Alice should try to create her second zombie. The only thing that's different is that this time, the zombie name should be set to `zombieNames[1]`.
- At this point, we expect the contract to `throw` an error.
- Since our test should pass only if the smart contract errors out, our logic will look a bit different. We’ll have to wrap the second `createRandomZombie` function call inside of a `try/catch` block as follows:

```javascript
try {
    //try to create the second zombie
    await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[1], {from: alice});
    assert(true);
  }
  catch (err) {
    return;
  }
assert(false, "The contract did not throw.");
```
Now we've got exactly what we wanted, right?

Hmmm... we're pretty close but not quite there.

In order to keep our tests nice and tidy we've moved the code above to `helpers/utils.js` and imported it into “CryptoZombies.js” like so:

```javascript
const utils = require("./helpers/utils");
```

And this is how the line of code that calls the function should look like:

```javascript
await utils.shouldThrow(myAwesomeContractInstance.myAwesomeFunction());
```

# Put it to the test

In the previous chapter, we've created an empty shell for our second test. Let's fill it in.

1.  First, let's have Alice create her first zombie. Give it `zombieNames[0]` as the name and don't forget to properly set the owner.

2.  After Alice created her first zombie, run `shouldThrow` with `createRandomZombie` as the parameter. If you can't remember the syntax for doing this, check the example from above. But first, try to do it without peeking.

Awesome, you've just finished writing your second test!

Now, we've gone ahead and run `truffle test` for you. Here's the output:

```bash
Contract: CryptoZombies
    ✓ should be able to create a new zombie (129ms)
    ✓ should not allow two zombies (148ms)


  2 passing (1s)
```

The test passed. Hooray!
