Welcome to the second part of our series about building an oracle. This lesson picks up where we left off last time, and we're going to look at how to:

* Implement the JavaScript component of the oracle.
* Write a simple Node.js client that interacts with the oracle. To keep things simple, you won't be building a fully-fledged web interface, but the code you'll write in this lesson will help you understand all the key aspects.
* To glue everything together, we'll teach you how to deploy the smart contracts and run the oracle.

Note that this is an advanced lesson and it requires:

* A bit of **JavaScript** knowledge.
* A basic understanding of `web3`. If you donâ€™t know how `web3` works, don't worry. We've got you covered. Just head over to <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/6" target=_blank>Lesson 6</a> first.
