Phew... the moment of truth has arrived: let's put the pieces of the puzzle together and see how this works.

We went ahead and started the oracle by running `node EthPriceOracle.js`.

Now, it's your turn.

## Put It to the test

 1. Fire up a terminal window, and start the client by entering the following command: `node Client.js`.

See how fast the price gets updatedðŸ˜‰! Well... this is just a simulation, but our blockchain is pretty fast too. Be sure to try it out yourself!
