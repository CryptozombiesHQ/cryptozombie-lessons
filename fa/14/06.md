The caller contract logic is **_almost complete_**, but there's one more thing you should take care of.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, calling the Binance public API is an asynchronous operation. Thus, the caller smart contract must provide a `callback` function which the oracle should call at a later time, namely when the ETH price is fetched.

Here's how the `callback` function works:

* First, you would want to make sure that the function can only be called for a valid `id`. For that, you'll use a `require` statement.

  Simply put, a `require` statement throws an error and stops the execution of the function if a condition is `false`.

  Let's look at an example from the Solidity official documentation:

  ```solidity
  require(msg.sender == chairperson, "Only chairperson can give right to vote.");
  ```

  The first parameter evaluates to `true` or `false`. If it's `false`, the function execution will stop and the smart contract will throw an error- "Only chairperson can give right to vote."

* Once you know that the `id` is valid, you can go ahead and remove it from the `myRequests` mapping.

  >Note: To remove an element from a mapping, you can use something like the following: `delete myMapping[key]`;

* Lastly, your function should fire an event to let the front-end know the price was successfully updated.

## Put It to the Test

We've gone ahead and declared a `public` function called `callback`. It takes two arguments of type `uint256`: `_ethPrice` and `_id`.

1. After the line that declares your smart contract, create a `uint256` variable called `ethPrice`. Let's make it `private` and don't assign it to anything yet.

2. Create an event called `PriceUpdatedEvent`. It takes two parameters: `ethPrice` and `id`. Both parameters are of type `uint256`.

Next, let's fill in the body of the `callback` function.

3. The function should first check to make sure `myRequests[id]` is `true`. Use a `require` statement to do this. The first parameter should be `myRequests[id]` and the second parameter should be "This request is not in my pending list."

4. Next, save the new ETH price (the one that comes from the function parameters) into the `ethPrice` variable.

5. The function should then call `delete` to remove the current `id` from the `myRequests` mapping.

6. Lastly, let's fire the `PriceUpdatedEvent`. The arguments should come from the function arguments.

This was a lot of logic to implement, but there's still something you've left out. Can you guess what?

Give it a thought before moving to the next chapter.
