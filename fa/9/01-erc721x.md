      contract ZombieCard is ERC721XToken {

      }
---

In this lesson, we're going to be building the token contract for an example blockchain game.

It is roughly based on the way we implemented ERC721x in our own game at Loom Network, <a href="https://loom.games/" target=_blank>Zombie Battleground</a> — a blockchain-based collectible card game similar to Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone.

This way you'll get to see what a real-world use case looks like, and be more than equipped to adapt the implementation to your own game after you complete this lesson.

For our first chapter, let's start with some background to make sure we're all on the same page...

## Background: What is a Token, Anyway?

Referring to in-game items as "tokens" can be a bit misleading, since the word "token" implies something that would be spent like a currency.

But the word **_token_** on Ethereum simply refers to a standard for smart contracts that all implement the same common functions, such as `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)` and `balanceOf(address _owner)`.

Yes, you can transfer and have a balance of a currency — but you can also transfer and have an inventory of items in a game, like swords or playing cards.

Even though a sword in a game isn't spendable like a currency — we *do* want these same basic functionalities for anything that a player can own.

Thus the concept of a "token" is useful for abstracting out these common methods so they can be applied into all items we put into our game — this way all game items on Ethereum share a common interface, and can be supported by any wallet or marketplace that adheres to the same token standard.

## Different Token Standards: ERC20 and ERC721

The most commonly known token standard is the **_ERC20 token_**. These tokens act like currencies. But they're not particularly useful for representing digital items, such as cards in a card trading game.

First of all, cards aren't divisible like currencies — you can't own 2/5ths of a playing card.

Second, not all cards are created equal, so they're not interchangeable. You wouldn't want to exchange your **Z-Virus** card for my **Ozmoziz**.

There's another token standard that's a much better fit for crypto-collectibles — and they're called **_ERC721 tokens._**

**_ERC721 tokens_** are **not** interchangeable. Each item is assumed to be unique, and has a unique ID. They're also not divisible — you can only trade them in whole units.

So these are a better fit for making our card trading game.

You noticed that I said they're a **better** fit — not perfect, right? 😉

## ERC721x — Best of Both Worlds

The issue with ERC721 for in-game items is that most games **do** have some items that are identical.

For example, say our card game has 300 different cards. But each of these cards needs more than one copy — otherwise not many people could play our game!

Multiple copies of the same card ARE (for the most part) interchangeable. So it makes sense to have a token standard that takes this into account.

ERC721x handles this use case by allowing you to define multiple tokens (think of them as card templates), and for each card you can define things like the total number of cards that will exist.

You'll see how, as we walk you through step by step in the coming chapters 👨‍🏫

## Getting Started: Using ERC721x In Your Project

When implementing a new ERC721x token, there's no need to start from scratch. Just like you would start your ERC20 token by copying a template from somewhere like <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity" target=_blank>Open Zeppelin</a> and making any changes you need, for ERC721x you can start by including our implementation into your project.

To include it in your future projects, you can follow the instructions from our GitHub <a href="https://github.com/loomnetwork/erc721x" target=_blank>here</a>. But for this lesson, we've already gone ahead and included `ERC721XToken.sol` into your project.

Don't worry about understanding all the code yet — we'll be walking you through step by step the pieces you need to understand.

# Put It to the Test

Let's start with the basics: we'll create a new contract called "ZombieCard" that inherits the logic from `ERC721XToken`.

1. First, declare at the top that we're using `pragma solidity ^0.4.25`.

2. After declaring the pragma, `import` the file `./ERC721XToken.sol`

3. Next, declare a new `contract` named "ZombieCard". It should inherit from `ERC721XToken` using the keyword `is`. Leave the body of the contract empty for now.

> Note: If you can't remember the basics and are getting lost, you can review <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/1/chapter/2">Lesson 1 Chapter 2</a> and <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/en/lesson/2/chapter/5">Lesson 2 Chapter 5</a>.
