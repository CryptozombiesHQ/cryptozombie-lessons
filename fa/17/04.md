Great! Now you know how to instantiate a zkSyncWallet. Doing this gets you halfway to creating a new account on zkSync. Next, you should make it so that your application can submit transactions to zkSync on behalf of users.

## Authorize your signing key

We've mentioned that you can use your zkSync wallet to transfer assets between accounts. However, before you can do that, you will have to authorize your zkSync signing key by performing the following tasks:

* Verify that a signing key has already been set for your account. To do this, you can use the `isSigningKeySet` function:

  ```JavaScript
  if (!await wallet.isSigningKeySet()) {
    // Your signing keys have not been set. You'll place the logic for setting it here.
  }
  ```

* Once you've determined that a signing key has not been set, you must make sure that the account exists on `zkSync` by calling the `getAccountId` function. If this function returns `undefined`, then it means that the account doesn't yet exist on `zkSync`:

  ```JavaScript
  if (await wallet.getAccountId() === undefined) {
    throw new Error('Unknown account')
  }
  ```

* Assuming a key has not been set yet you're ready to set your signing key as follows:

  ```JavaScript
  const changePubkey = await wallet.setSigningKey()
  ```

* The above function commits a transaction to the blockchain. Remember that this is an asynchronous operation that can **take a bit of time**. You'll have to `await` for the transaction to be committed:

  ```JavaScript
  await changePubkey.awaitReceipt()
  ```

## Put it to the test

We've gone ahead and created the `registerAccount` function. Let's now focus on filling it in.

1. Verify that a signing key has been set for your account. You can reference the sample code above to see how you can do this.

2. Inside the `if` block you've created in the first step, copy and paste the snippet that checks if your account has been created on zkSync.

3. Outside the second `if` block, but inside the first one, call the `wallet.setSigningKey` and store the result in a `const` variable named `changePubkey`. This is an asynchronous function. Make sure you `await` for the promise to resolve!

4. Just below the line of code that calls the `wallet.setSigningKey` function (still inside the first `if` statement) invoke the `awaitReceipt` function, as shown in the sample code above.
