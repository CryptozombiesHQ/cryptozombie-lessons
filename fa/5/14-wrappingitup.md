Congratulations! That concludes Lesson 5.

As a reward, we've transferred you your very own Level 10 **H4XF13LD MORRIS 💯💯😎💯💯** zombie!

(Omg, the legendary **H4XF13LD MORRIS 💯💯😎💯💯** zombie!!!!111)

Now you have 4 zombies in your army.

Before you move on, you have the option to rename any of them if you'd like by clicking on them to the right and entering a new name. (Though I don't know why you would ever want to rename **H4XF13LD MORRIS 💯💯😎💯💯**, clearly the best name ever).

## Let's recap:

In this lesson we learned about:

- Tokens, the ERC721 standard, and tradable assets/zombies
- Libraries and how to use them
- How to prevent overflows and underflows using the SafeMath library
- Commenting your code and the natspec standard

This lesson concludes our game's Solidity code! (For now — we may add even more lessons in the future).

In the next 2 lessons, we're going to look at how to deploy your contracts and interact with them using **_web3.js_** (so you can build a front-end for your DApp).

Go ahead and rename any of your zombies if you like, then proceed to the next chapter to complete the lesson.
