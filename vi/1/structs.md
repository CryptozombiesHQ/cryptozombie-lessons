Sometimes you need a more complex data type. For this, Solidity provides **_structs_**:

```
struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}

```

Structs allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties.

> Note that we just introduced a new type, `string`. Strings are used for arbitrary-length UTF-8 data. Ex. `string greeting = "Hello world!"`

# Put it to the test

In our app, we're going to want to create some zombies! And zombies will have multiple properties, so this is a perfect use case for a struct.

1. Create a `struct` named `Zombie`.

2. Our `Zombie` struct will have 2 properties: `name` (a `string`), and `dna` (a `uint`).
