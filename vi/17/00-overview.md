Welcome!

In this lesson, we will teach you the basics of zkSync, by walking you through setting up a shop where a customer (Alice) can buy goods from a shopkeeper (Bob)

## What is zkSync?

Recently there’s been some interesting research on using zero-knowledge proofs to secure token transfers between Ethereum and side-chains, and there’s now a practical implementation of this research in the form of **zkSync** from Matter Labs.

zkSync is built on the ZK rollup architecture, a level-two scaling solution in which all funds are held by a smart contract on Ethereum, while computation and storage are performed off-chain.

## Why should you care about zkSync?

This is the short answer to why we think zkSync is important:

* The protocol allows ETH and ERC20 token transfers with **_instant confirmations_** and 10 min finality on Ethereum.
* Provides Mainnet-level security with **_zero reliance on 3rd parties_**.
* Low transaction fees
* Fast deposits and withdrawals

## How does zkSync work?

In a nutshell, users can send their ETH or ERC20 tokens to the zkSync smart contract on Ethereum, and the protocol will credit them with the equivalent assets. For simplicity, this tutorial will only cover how you can make ETH payments.

## What will you learn in this lesson?

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Set up accounts on zkSync
* Deposit ETH to zkSync
* Make payments by transferring ETH between zkSync accounts
* Track the status of these transactions.
* Withdraw ETH to Ethereum

Let's get started!
