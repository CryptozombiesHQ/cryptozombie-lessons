Impressive! You must have been practicing.

Now, this tutorial would not be complete without showing you how to test against **_Loom_** Testnet.

Recall from our previous lessons that, on  **_Loom_**, users have access to much speedier and gas-free transactions than on **Ethereum**. This makes DAppChains a much better fit for something like a game or a user-facing DApp.

And you know what? Deploying and testing against **Loom** is not different at all. We've gone ahead and summed up what needs to be done so you can test against **_Loom_**. Let's have a quick look.

## Configure Truffle for Testing on **Loom**

First things first. Let's tell Truffle how to deploy to Loom Testnet by placing the following snippet inside the `networks` object.

```javascript
    loom_testnet: {
      provider: function() {
        const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';
        const chainId = 'extdev-plasma-us1';
        const writeUrl = 'wss://extdev-basechain-us1.dappchains.com/websocket';
        const readUrl = 'wss://extdev-basechain-us1.dappchains.com/queryws';
        return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
      },
      network_id: 'extdev'
    }
```

>Note: Never reveal your private key! We are only doing this for the sake of simplicity. A much safer solution would be to save your private key into a file and read its value from that file. If you do this, make sure you avoid pushing the file in which you saved your private key to GitHub, where anyone can see it.

## The accounts array

In order to make _Truffle_ "talk" to **Loom** we've replaced the default `HDWalletProvider` with our own <a href="https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-truffle-provider" target=_blank>Truffle Provider</a>. As a result, we have to tell our provider to fill in the `accounts` array so we can test our game. In order to do that, we are required to replace the line of code that `return`s a new `LoomTruffleProvider`:

```javascript
return new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey)
```

 with this:

```javascript
const loomTruffleProvider = new LoomTruffleProvider(chainId, writeUrl, readUrl, privateKey);
loomTruffleProvider.createExtraAccountsFromMnemonic(mnemonic, 10);
return loomTruffleProvider;
```

# Put it to the test

1.  Replace the line of code that `return`s a new `LoomTruffleProvider` with the snippet from above.


There's one more thing we should take care of. Time traveling is only available when testing against _Ganache_ so we should skip this test. You already know how to _skip_ a test by placing an `x` in front of the function name. However, this time we want you to learn something new. Long story short... you can _skip_ a test by simply chaining a `skip()` function call as follows:

```javascript
it.skip("zombies should be able to attack another zombie", async () => {
    //We're skipping the body of the function for brevity
    })
```

We've gone ahead and skipped the test for you. Then, we ran `truffle test --network loom_testnet`.

If you enter the commands from above, the output should look something like this:

```bash
Contract: CryptoZombies
    ✓ should be able to create a new zombie (6153ms)
    ✓ should not allow two zombies (12895ms)
    ✓ should return the correct owner (6962ms)
    - zombies should be able to attack another zombie
    with the single-step transfer scenario
      ✓ should transfer a zombie (13810ms)
    with the two-step transfer scenario
      ✓ should approve and then transfer a zombie when the approved address calls transferFrom (22388ms)


  5 passing (2m)
  1 pending
  ```

That’s all for now, folks! We have finished testing our `CryptoZombies` smart contract.
