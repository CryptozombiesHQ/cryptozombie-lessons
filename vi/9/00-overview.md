Welcome, CryptoZombie!

In this intermediate lesson, we will be learning about **ERC721x Multi-Fungible Tokens**.

What is a multi-fungible token, you ask?

With Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) like ERC721, every item is totally 100% unique. But Multi-Fungible Tokens recognize that in most games, you will want to have *multiple identical copies of the same item*.

For example, your Master Sword is probably exactly the same as my Master Sword — they look the same, do the same damage, and have the exact same functionality. Thus we would call these items "fungible", because we could trade our Master Swords without either one of us minding — there is no difference between them.

Of course, this isn't always the case. For some items, maybe we do want them to be one of a kind.

Thus, ERC721x gives you the flexibility to do both — and to manage all the items in your game, both fungible and non-fungible, within one single smart contract. And best of all, it's fully backward-compatible with ERC721.

In this lesson, you will learn how to use it in your game.

Are you ready to get started?
