Now that our base contract `ZombieFactory` inherits from `Ownable`, we can use the `onlyOwner` function modifier in `ZombieFeeding` as well.

This is because of how contract inheritance works. Remember:

```
ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory
ZombieFactory is Ownable
```

Thus `ZombieFeeding` is also `Ownable`, and can access the functions / events / modifiers from the `Ownable` contract. This applies to any contracts that inherit from `ZombieFeeding` in the future as well.

## Function Modifiers

A function modifier looks just like a function, but uses the keyword `modifier` instead of the keyword `function`. And it can't be called directly like a function can — instead we can attach the modifier's name at the end of a function definition to change that function's behavior.

Let's take a closer look by examining `onlyOwner`:

```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

/**
 * @title Ownable
 * @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
 * functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
 */
contract Ownable {
  address private _owner;

  event OwnershipTransferred(
    address indexed previousOwner,
    address indexed newOwner
  );

  /**
   * @dev The Ownable constructor sets the original `owner` of the contract to the sender
   * account.
   */
  constructor() internal {
    _owner = msg.sender;
    emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), _owner);
  }

  /**
   * @return the address of the owner.
   */
  function owner() public view returns(address) {
    return _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
   */
  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(isOwner());
    _;
  }

  /**
   * @return true if `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract.
   */
  function isOwner() public view returns(bool) {
    return msg.sender == _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @dev Allows the current owner to relinquish control of the contract.
   * @notice Renouncing to ownership will leave the contract without an owner.
   * It will not be possible to call the functions with the `onlyOwner`
   * modifier anymore.
   */
  function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
    emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, address(0));
    _owner = address(0);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a newOwner.
   * @param newOwner The address to transfer ownership to.
   */
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Transfers control of the contract to a newOwner.
   * @param newOwner The address to transfer ownership to.
   */
  function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
    require(newOwner != address(0));
    emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, newOwner);
    _owner = newOwner;
  }
}
```

Notice the `onlyOwner` modifier on the `renounceOwnership` function. When you call `renounceOwnership`, the code inside `onlyOwner` executes **first**. Then when it hits the `_;` statement in `onlyOwner`, it goes back and executes the code inside `renounceOwnership`.

So while there are other ways you can use modifiers, one of the most common use-cases is to add a quick `require` check before a function executes.

In the case of `onlyOwner`, adding this modifier to a function makes it so **only** the **owner** of the contract (you, if you deployed it) can call that function.

>Note: Giving the owner special powers over the contract like this is often necessary, but it could also be used maliciously. For example, the owner could add a backdoor function that would allow him to transfer anyone's zombies to himself!

>So it's important to remember that just because a DApp is on Ethereum does not automatically mean it's decentralized — you have to actually read the full source code to make sure it's free of special controls by the owner that you need to potentially worry about. There's a careful balance as a developer between maintaining control over a DApp such that you can fix potential bugs, and building an owner-less platform that your users can trust to secure their data.

## Put it to the test

Now we can restrict access to `setKittyContractAddress` so that no one but us can modify it in the future.

1. Add the `onlyOwner` modifier to `setKittyContractAddress`.
