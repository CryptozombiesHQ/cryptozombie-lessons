  who_made1: CryptoZombies was made by the team at 
  who_made2: . We're building a platform for running large-scale applications on Ethereum sidechains.
  who_made3: We think blockchains are capable of a lot more than just payments, and we want to get more developers thinking outside the box and trying to build large-scale DApps. Games are one of the areas where we think blockchain will really revolutionize things. So we built CryptoZombies to help educate and inspire the next generation of blockchain game devs.
