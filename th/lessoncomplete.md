Well done!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

You mastered the art of deploying smart contracts using **Truffle**!

Remember, building on top of **_Loom_** brings you faster, gas-free transactions that make it the perfect choice for creating blockchain games and user-facing DApps. At the same time, your users will enjoy the guaranteed security that Ethereum provides!

Another thing to remember is how similar deploying to **_Loom_** is to deploying to the Ethereum mainnet. You now know how to do both, just be careful how you choose which one to use for your next project😉.

Anyway, this was just an example — we made several decisions that simplified things a bit to make the lesson easier to understand.

To further your knowledge, head over to the <a href="https://loomx.io/developers/en/intro-to-loom.html" target=_blank>Developer's Documentation</a> page.

Happy coding!
