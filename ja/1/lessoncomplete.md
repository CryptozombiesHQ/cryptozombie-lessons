You finished testing the game. You are nothing short of extraordinary!

Even though in this case our game was built for demo purposes, it's clear that testing a Solidity smart contract is no mean feat. But we know that now you are well equipped to test your smart contracts!

The important things to remember are:

- Make sure you create a separate test for each function in your game.
- Keep everything clearly labelled and organized
- Make use of time travelling
- Consider using Loom when developing a game or a user-facing DApp. We highly recommend you to get started by checking out <a href="https://loomx.io/developers/" target=_blank>our documentation</a>.
