We want our `_generateRandomDna` function to return a (semi) random `uint`. How can we accomplish this?

Ethereum has the hash function `keccak256` built in, which is a version of SHA3. A hash function basically maps an input string into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. A slight change in the string will cause a large change in the hash.

It's useful for many purposes in Ethereum, but for right now we're just going to use it for pseudo-random number generation.

Example:

    //6e91ec6b618bb462a4a6ee5aa2cb0e9cf30f7a052bb467b0ba58b8748c00d2e5
    keccak256("aaaab");
    //b1f078126895a1424524de5321b339ab00408010b7cf0e6ed451514981e58aa9
    keccak256("aaaac");
    

As you can see, the returned values are totally different despite only a 1 character change in the input.

> Note: **Secure** random-number generation in blockchain is a very difficult problem. Our method here is insecure, but since security isn't top priority for our Zombie DNA, it will be good enough for our purposes.

## Typecasting

Sometimes you need to convert between data types. Take the following example:

    uint8 a = 5;
    uint b = 6;
    // throws an error because a * b returns a uint, not uint8:
    uint8 c = a * b; 
    // we have to typecast b as a uint8 to make it work:
    uint8 c = a * uint8(b); 
    

In the above, `a * b` returns a `uint`, but we were trying to store it as a `uint8`, which could cause potential problems. By casting it as a `uint8`, it works and the compiler won't throw an error.

# Put it to the test

Let's fill in the body of our `_generateRandomDna` function! Here's what it should do:

1. The first line of code should take the `keccak256` hash of `_str` to generate a pseudo-random hexadecimal, typecast it as a `uint`, and finally store the result in a `uint` called `rand`.

2. We want our DNA to only be 16 digits long (remember our `dnaModulus`?). So the second line of code should `return` the above value modulus (`%`) `dnaModulus`.
