 Now we have everything in place to deploy to **Loom** with just one command. Yeah, you've made it look simple!💪🏻

# Put it to the test:

1. Run `truffle migrate --network loom_dapp_chain`. Check out the console log. Grab the contract's address and put it somewhere safe. We are going to need it to interact with the smart contract.
