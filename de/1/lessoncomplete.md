Congratulations, you’ve made it to the end!

In this lesson, you started exploring how you can build and interact with a centralized oracle by writing two simple smart contracts.

In the next lesson, we'll put together the missing pieces by implementing:

* The JavaScript component of the oracle. This fetches the ETH price from the Binance public API
* A bare-bones client that ties everything together.

Until then, stay tuned and happy coding!
