A function declaration in solidity looks like the following:

    function eatHamburgers(string _name, uint _amount) {
    
    }
    

This is a function named `eatHamburgers` that takes 2 parameters: a `string` and a `uint`. For now the body of the function is empty.

> Note: It's convention (but not required) to start function parameter variable names with an underscore (`_`) in order to differentiate them from global variables. We'll use that convention throughout our tutorial.

You would call this function like so:

    eatHamburgers("vitalik", 100);
    

# Put it to the test

In our app, we're going to need to be able to create some zombies. Let's create a function for that.

1. Create a function named `createZombie`. It should take two parameters: **__name_** (a `string`), and **__dna_** (a `uint`).

Leave the body empty for now — we'll fill it in later.
