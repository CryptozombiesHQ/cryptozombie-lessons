In this chapter, we're going to learn about Function ***return values***, and function modifiers.

## Return Values

To return a value from a function, the declaration looks like this:

    string greeting = "What's up dog";
    
    function sayHello() public returns (string) {
      return greeting;
    }
    

In Solidity, the function declaration contains the type of the return value (in this case `string`).

## Function modifiers

The above function doesn't actually change state in Solidity — e.g. it doesn't change any values or write anything.

So in this case we could declare it as a ***view*** function, meaning it's only viewing the data but not modifying it:

    function sayHello() public view returns (string) {
    

Solidity also contains ***pure*** functions, which means you're not even accessing any data in the app. Consider the following:

    function _multiply(uint a, uint b) private pure returns (uint) {
      return a * b;
    }
    

This function doesn't even read from the state of the app — its return value depends only on its function parameters. So in this case we would declare the function as ***pure***.

> Note: It may be hard to remember when to mark functions as pure/view. Luckily the Solidity compiler is good about issuing warnings to let you know when you should use one of these modifiers.

# Put it to the test

We're going to want a helper function that generates a random DNA number from a string.

1. Create a `private` function called `_generateRandomDna`. It will take one parameter named `_str` (a `string`), and return a `uint`.

2. This function will view some of our contract's variables but not modify them, so mark it as `view`.

3. The function body should be empty at this point — we'll fill it in later.
